Code Composer Studio for MacOS README
---------------------------------------

If you are using the lightweight Web installer DMG, open the DMG and run the installer application.

If you are using an Offline CCS Installer, run the installer by opening the DMG and executing the installer application.

Known issues
------------
* Clicking the cancel button in the Offline installer before the installation has started will result in an error message about being unable to copy the log file. This can be safely ignored.
