Code Composer Studio for Windows README
-----------------------------------------

Please note that use of anti-virus software or a firewall may cause issues
during installation.  McAfee software in particular has been especially
troublesome.  If possible, disable anti-virus and firewall software during
installation.  If not, use of the Offline Installer is strongly recommended.

If you are using an Offline CCS Installer, the zip file in which it is
distributed must first be extracted:

    1. Right-click on CCSxx.x.x.xxxxx_win64.zip and select "Extract All...".
    2. Enter the directory where you wish to extract the files.
    3. Click on Extract.

Once extraction has successfully completed, proceed with the installation
steps below.
