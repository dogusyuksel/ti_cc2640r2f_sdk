CC2538 Device Support
Version: 2.00.04.11
Date: 2018-10-31

-------------------------
Release Notes:
-------------------------
Version 2.00.04.11 (2018-10-31):
- Fixed potential memory leak issue in host flashloader library where class
  member variable was not released in destructor (LPRFTOOLS-603).
- This is the first release supporting win64 platforms (LPRFTOOLS-329).

-------------------------
Manual installation:
-------------------------
1. Make sure CCS 6.2.0.048 or higher is installed.
2. Copy the folder 'ccs_base' into 'ccs_base' in the CCS installation (i.e. merge the folders)

-------------------------
Known issues:
-------------------------
- Device is not halted on connect when programmed with image that does not
  implement workaround code for CC2538 system reset bug. Workaround code is
  in the default startup_ccs.c (preprocessor symbol DEBUG must be defined).
- The above issue combined with low power modes may cause CPU reset error
  when trying to program/verify device content. Doing a mass erase in CCS, or
  "-b Erase" in CCS Uniflash CLI will erase the device, allowing the flash
  to be programmed.
