                                <p>The C compiler supports the 1989 <span>and 1999 </span>versions of the C language:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">
                                        <b>C89.</b> Compiling with the --c89 option causes the compiler to conform to the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 C standard, which was previously ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989. The names "C89" and "C90" refer to the same programming language. "C89" is used in this document.</li>

                                        <b>C99.</b> Compiling with the --c99 option causes the compiler to conform to the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 C standard. This standard supports several features not part of C89, such as inline functions, new data types, and one-line comments beginning with //.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The C language is also described in the second edition of Kernighan and Ritchie's <i>The C Programming Language</i> (K&amp;R). The compiler can also accept many of the language extensions found in the GNU C compiler (see <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0556475">Section 5.16</a></span>). </p>
                                <p>The compiler supports some features of C99 in the default relaxed ANSI mode with C89 support.<span> It supports all language features of C99 in C99 mode.</span> See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0552910">Section 5.15</a></span>.</p>
                                <p>The ANSI/ISO standard identifies some features of the C language that may be affected by characteristics of the target processor, run-time environment, or host environment. This set of features can differ among standard compilers.</p>
                                <p>Unsupported features of the C library are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">The run-time library has minimal support for wide and multibyte characters. The type wchar_t is implemented as <span>unsigned int (16-bits)</span>. The wide character set is equivalent to the set of values of type char. The library includes the header files &lt;wchar.h&gt; and &lt;wctype.h&gt;, but does not include all the functions specified in the standard.</li>
                                    <li value="2">The run-time library includes the header file &lt;locale.h&gt;, but with a minimal implementation. The only supported locale is the C locale. That is, library behavior that is specified to vary by locale is hard-coded to the behavior of the C locale, and attempting to install a different locale by way of a call to setlocale() will return NULL.</li>
                                    <li value="3">Some run-time functions and features in the C99 specification are not supported. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0552910">Section 5.15</a></span>.</li>

                                    <p>The C standard requires that conforming implementations provide documentation on how the compiler handles instances of implementation-defined behavior.</p>
                                    <p>The TI compiler officially supports a freestanding environment. The C standard does not require a freestanding environment to supply every C feature; in particular the library need not be complete. However, the TI compiler strives to provide most features of a hosted environment.</p>

The numbers in parentheses at the end of each item are sections in the C99 standard that discuss the topic.

It is the user's responsibility to make sure the access size is appropriate for devices that only tolerate accesses of certain widths. The TI compiler does not change the number of accesses to a volatile variable unless absolutely necessary. This is significant for read-modify-write expressions such as += ; for an architecture which does not have a corresponding read-modify-write instruction, the compiler will be forced to use two accesses, one for the read and one for the write. Even for architectures with such instructions, it is not guaranteed that the compiler will be able to map such expressions to an instruction with a single memory operand. It is not guaranteed that the memory system will lock that memory location for the duration of the instruction. In a multi-core system, some other core may write the location after a RMW instruction reads it, but before it writes the result. The TI compiler will not reorder two volatile accesses, but it may reorder a volatile and a non-volatile access, so volatile cannot be used to create a critical section. Use some sort of lock if you need to create a critical section. (6.7.3)</li>

However, there is no low-level file I/O for wide chars. Also, the C library interface to wide char support (through the C++ headers &lt;cwchar&gt; and &lt;cwctype&gt;) is limited as described above in the C library.</li>

                                <p>MISRA C is a set of software development guidelines for the C programming language. It promotes best practices in developing safety-related electronic systems in road vehicles and other embedded systems. MISRA C was originally launched in 1998 by the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association, and has since been adopted across a wide variety of industries. A subsequent update to the guidelines was publishes as MISRA C:2004</p>
                                <p>You can alter your code to work with the MISRA C:2004 rules. The following options and pragmas can be used to enable/disable rules:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">The --check_misra option enables checking of the specified MISRA C:2004 rules. This compiler option must be used if you want to enable further control over checking using the CHECK_MISRA and RESET_MISRA pragmas.</li>
                                    <li value="2"> The CHECK_MISRA pragma enables/disables MISRA C:2004 rules at the source level. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0552259">Section 5.11.3</a></span>.</li>

                                <p>The <i>char</i> type is unsigned by default. This is in contrast to the "signed char" and "unsigned char" types, which specify their sign behavior. You can change the default for the "char" type using the <span class="code">--plain_char=signed</span> compiler option.</p>
                                <p>The additional types from C, C99 and C++ are defined as synonyms for standard types:</p>
                                <code>    typedef unsigned int wchar_t;
 typedef unsigned int wint_t;</code>
                                <p> MSP devices support multiple data and code memory models. The code and data model affects the size, alignment, and storage space used for function pointers, data pointers, the size_t type, and the ptrdiff_t type. Pointers with sizes that are not a power of 2 are always stored in a container with a size of a power of 2 bits. That is, 20-bit types are stored in 32 bits.</p>

                                    <p>An enum type is represented by an underlying integer type. The size of the integer type and whether it is signed is based on the range of values of the enumerated constants.</p>
                                    <p>In strict C89 or C99 mode, the compiler allows only enumeration constants with values that will fit in "int" or "unsigned int". </p>
                                    <p>For C++ and relaxed C89/C99, the compiler allows enumeration constants up to the largest integral type (<span>64 bits</span>). The default, which is recommended, is for the underlying type to be the first type in the following list in which all the enumerated constant values can be represented: <span>int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long long long, unsigned long long</span>.</p>
                                    <p>If you use the --small_enum option, the smallest possible byte size for the enumeration type is used. The underlying type is the first type in the following list in which all the enumerated constant values can be represented: <span>signed char, unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long long</span>.</p>
                                    <p>The following example uses 8 bits instead of 16 bits when the --small_enum option is used. </p>

                                        <span class="section-label">5.7.1 </span>The const Keyword</h4>
                                    <p>The C/C++ compiler supports the ANSI/ISO standard keyword <i>const</i> in all modes.</p>
                                    <p>This keyword gives you greater optimization and control over allocation of storage for certain data objects. You can apply the const qualifier to the definition of any variable or array to ensure that its value is not altered.</p>
                                    <p>Global objects qualified as const are placed in the <span>.const</span> section. The linker allocates the <span>.const</span> section from ROM or FLASH, which are typically more plentiful than RAM. The const data storage allocation rule has the following exceptions:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">If <i>volatile</i> is also specified in the object definition. For example, <span class="code">volatile const int</span><span class="code">x</span>. Volatile keywords are assumed to be allocated to RAM. (The program is not allowed to modify a const volatile object, but something external to the program might.)</li>
                                        <li value="2">If the object has automatic storage (<span>function scope</span>).</li>
                                        <li id="t365168-32" value="3">If the object is a C++ object with a "mutable" member.</li>
                                        <li id="t365168-33" value="4"> If the object is initialized with a value that is not known at compile time (such as the value of another variable).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>In these cases, the storage for the object is the same as if the const keyword were not used.</p>
                                    <p>The placement of the const keyword within a definition is important. For example, the first statement below defines a constant pointer p to a modifiable int. The second statement defines a modifiable pointer q to a constant int:</p>
                                    <code>int * const p = &amp;x;
const int * q = &amp;x;</code>
                                    <p>Using the const keyword, you can define large constant tables and allocate them into system ROM. For example, to allocate a ROM table, you could use the following definition:</p>
                                    <code>const int digits[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};</code>

                                        <span class="section-label">5.7.2 </span>The __interrupt Keyword</h4>
                                    <p>The compiler extends the C/C++ language by adding the __interrupt keyword, which specifies that a function is treated as an interrupt function. This keyword is an IRQ interrupt. The alternate keyword, "interrupt", may also be used except in strict ANSI C or C++ modes.</p>
                                    <p>Note that the interrupt function attribute described in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0556804">Section 5.11.18</a></span> is the recommended syntax for declaring interrupt functions.</p>
                                    <p>Functions that handle interrupts follow special register-saving rules and a special return sequence. The implementation stresses safety. The interrupt routine does not assume that the C run-time conventions for the various CPU register and status bits are in effect; instead, it re-establishes any values assumed by the run-time environment. When C/C++ code is interrupted, the interrupt routine must preserve the contents of all machine registers that are used by the routine or by any function called by the routine. When you use the __interrupt keyword with the definition of the function, the compiler generates register saves based on the rules for interrupt functions and the special return sequence for interrupts.</p>
                                    <p>You can only use the __interrupt keyword with a function that is defined to return void and that has no parameters. The body of the interrupt function can have local variables and is free to use the stack or global variables. For example:</p>
                                    <code>__interrupt void int_handler()
{ unsigned int flags;
 ...}</code>
                                    <p>The name c_int00 is the C/C++ entry point. This name is reserved for the system reset interrupt. This special interrupt routine initializes the system and calls the main() function. Because it has no caller, c_int00 does not save any registers.</p>

                                    <p>To help the compiler determine memory dependencies, you can qualify a pointer, reference, or array with the restrict keyword. The restrict keyword is a type qualifier that can be applied to pointers, references, and arrays. Its use represents a guarantee by you, the programmer, that within the scope of the pointer declaration the object pointed to can be accessed only by that pointer. Any violation of this guarantee renders the program undefined. This practice helps the compiler optimize certain sections of code because aliasing information can be more easily determined.</p>
                                    <p>In <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0556851">Example 5-1</a></span>, the restrict keyword is used to tell the compiler that the function func1 is never called with the pointers a and b pointing to objects that overlap in memory. You are promising that accesses through a and b will never conflict; therefore, a write through one pointer cannot affect a read from any other pointers. The precise semantics of the restrict keyword are described in the 1999 version of the ANSI/ISO C Standard.</p>
                                    <p>The "restrict" keyword is a C99 keyword, and cannot be accepted in strict ANSI C89 mode. Use the "__restrict" keyword if the strict ANSI C89 mode must be used. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0552910">Section 5.15</a></span>.</p>

                                        <span class="section-label">5.7.4 </span>The volatile Keyword</h4>
                                    <p>The C/C++ compiler supports the <i>volatile</i> keyword in all modes. In addition, the __volatile keyword is supported in relaxed ANSI mode for C89, C99, and C++.</p>
                                    <p>The volatile keyword indicates to the compiler that there is something about how the variable is accessed that requires that the compiler not use overly-clever optimization on expressions involving that variable. For example, the variable may also be accessed by an external program, <span>an interrupt, </span>another thread, or a peripheral device.</p>
                                    <p>The compiler eliminates redundant memory accesses whenever possible, using data flow analysis to figure out when it is legal. However, some memory accesses may be special in some way that the compiler cannot see, and in such cases you should use the volatile keyword to prevent the compiler from optimizing away something important. The compiler does not optimize out any accesses to variables declared volatile. The number of volatile reads and writes will be exactly as they appear in the C/C++ code, no more and no less and in the same order. </p>
                                    <p>Any variable which might be modified by something external to the obvious control flow of the program<span> (such as an interrupt service routine)</span> must be declared volatile. This tells the compiler that <span>an interrupt function</span> might modify the value at any time, so the compiler should not perform optimizations which will change the number or order of accesses of that variable. This is the primary purpose of the volatile keyword. In the following example, the loop intends to wait for a location to be read as 0xFF:</p>
                                    <code>   unsigned int *ctrl;
 while (*ctrl !=0xFF);</code>
                                    <p>However, in this example, *ctrl is a loop-invariant expression, so the loop is optimized down to a single-memory read. To get the desired result, define ctrl as:</p>
                                    <code>   volatile unsigned int *ctrl;</code>
                                    <p>Here the *ctrl pointer is intended to reference a hardware location<span>, such as an interrupt flag</span>.</p>
                                    <p>The volatile keyword must also be used when accessing memory locations that represent memory-mapped peripheral devices. Such memory locations might change value in ways that the compiler cannot predict. These locations might change if accessed, or when some other memory location is accessed, or when some signal occurs. </p>
                                    <p>Volatile must also be used for local variables in a function which calls setjmp, if the value of the local variables needs to remain valid if a longjmp occurs.</p>

                                <p>The C/C++ compiler treats register variables (variables defined with the register keyword) differently, depending on whether you use the --opt_level (-O) option.</p>

                                    <p>The compiler ignores any register definitions and allocates registers to variables and temporary values by using an algorithm that makes the most efficient use of registers.</p>

                                    <p>If you use the register keyword, you can suggest variables as candidates for allocation into registers. The compiler uses the same set of registers for allocating temporary expression results as it uses for allocating register variables.</p>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The compiler attempts to honor all register definitions. If the compiler runs out of appropriate registers, it frees a register by moving its contents to memory. If you define too many objects as register variables, you limit the number of registers the compiler has for temporary expression results. This limit causes excessive movement of register contents to memory.</p>
                                <p>Any object with a scalar type (integral, floating point, or pointer) can be defined as a register variable. The register designator is ignored for objects of other types, such as arrays.</p>
                                <p>The register storage class is meaningful for parameters as well as local variables. Normally, in a function, some of the parameters are copied to a location on the stack where they are referenced during the function body. The compiler copies a register parameter to a register instead of the stack, which speeds access to the parameter within the function.</p>

                                <p> The C/C++ compiler can embed assembly language instructions or directives directly into the assembly language output of the compiler. This capability is an extension to the C/C++ language implemented through the<i> __asm</i> keyword. The __asm keyword provides access to hardware features that C/C++ cannot provide. </p>
                                <p>The alternate keyword, "asm", may also be used except in strict ANSI C mode. It is available in relaxed C and C++ modes.</p>
                                <p>Using __asm is syntactically performed as a call to a function named __asm, with one string constant argument:</p>

                                <p>The compiler copies the argument string directly into your output file. The assembler text must be enclosed in double quotes. All the usual character string escape codes retain their definitions. For example, you can insert a .byte directive that contains quotes as follows:</p>
                                <code>__asm("STR: .byte \"abc\"");</code>
                                <p>The inserted code must be a legal assembly language statement. Like all assembly language statements, the line of code inside the quotes must begin with a label, a blank, a tab, or a comment (asterisk or semicolon). The compiler performs no checking on the string; if there is an error, the assembler detects it. For more information about the assembly language statements, see the <i><span>MSP430</span> Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i>.</p>
                                <p>The __asm statements do not follow the syntactic restrictions of normal C/C++ statements. Each can appear as a statement or a declaration, even outside of blocks. This is useful for inserting directives at the very beginning of a compiled module.</p>
                                <p>The __asm statement does not provide any way to refer to local variables. If your assembly code needs to refer to local variables, you will need to write the entire function in assembly code.</p>

                                    <p>Be careful not to disrupt the C/C++ environment with __asm statements. The compiler does not check the inserted instructions. Inserting jumps and labels into C/C++ code can cause unpredictable results in variables manipulated in or around the inserted code. Directives that change sections or otherwise affect the assembly environment can also be troublesome.</p>
                                    <p>Be especially careful when you use optimization with __asm statements. Although the compiler cannot remove __asm statements, it can significantly rearrange the code order near them and cause undesired results.</p>

                                    <p>The CALLS pragma specifies a set of functions that can be called indirectly from a specified calling function. </p>
                                    <p>The CALLS pragma is used by the compiler to embed debug information about indirect calls in object files. Using the CALLS pragma on functions that make indirect calls enables such indirect calls to be included in calculations for such functions' inclusive stack sizes. For more information on generating function stack usage information, see the -cg option of the Object File Display Utility in the "Invoking the Object File Display Utility" section of the <i><span>MSP430</span> Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i>.</p>
                                    <p>The CALLS pragma can precede either the calling function's definition or its declaration. In C, the pragma must have at least 2 arguments—the first argument is the calling function, followed by at least one function that will be indirectly called from the calling function. In C++, the pragma applies to the next function declared or defined, and the pragma must have at least one argument. </p>
                                    <p>The syntax for the CALLS pragma in C is as follows. This indicates that calling_function can indirectly call function_1 through function_n.</p>

                                    <p>The diagnostic affected (<i>num</i>) is specified using either an error number or an error tag name. The equal sign (=) is optional. Any diagnostic can be overridden to be an error, but only diagnostic messages with a severity of discretionary error or below can have their severity reduced to a warning or below, or be suppressed. The diag_default pragma is used to return the severity of a diagnostic to the one that was in effect before any pragmas were issued (i.e., the normal severity of the message as modified by any command-line options).</p>
                                    <p>The diagnostic identifier number is output with the message when you use the -pden command line option. The following example suppresses a diagnostic message and then restores the previous diagnostics severity state:</p>

                                    <p> The FUNC_ALWAYS_INLINE pragma instructs the compiler to always inline the named function.

                                    <p>This pragma must appear before any declaration or reference to the function that you want to inline. In C, the argument <i>func</i> is the name of the function that will be inlined. In C++, the pragma applies to the next function declared.</p>

                                    <p> When you use the --program_level_compile option, the compiler uses program-level optimization. When you use this type of optimization, the compiler removes any function that is not called, directly or indirectly, by main(). You might have C/C++ functions that are called by hand-coded assembly instead of main().</p>

                                    <p>Global and static variables are zero-initialized. However, in applications that use non-volatile memory, it may be desirable to have variables that are not initialized. Noinit variables are global or static variables that are not zero-initialized at startup or reset.</p>
                                    <p>Persistent and noinit variables behave identically with the exception of whether or not they are initialized at load time.</p>
                                    <p>The NOINIT pragma may be used in conjunction with the LOCATION pragma to map variables to special memory locations, like memory-mapped registers, without generating unwanted writes. The NOINIT pragma may only be used with uninitialized variables.</p>
                                    <p>The PERSISTENT pragma is similar to the NOINIT pragma, except that it may only be used with statically-initialized variables. Persistent variables disable startup initialization; they are given an initial value when the code is loaded, but are never again initialized.</p>
                                    <span class="note">
                                        <p class="note_title">NOTE</p>
                                        <p>When using these pragmas in non-volatile FRAM memory, the memory region could be protected against unintended writes through the device's Memory Protection Unit. Some devices have memory protection enabled by default. Please see the information about memory protection in the datasheet for your device. If the Memory Protection Unit is enabled, it first needs to be disabled before modifying the variables.</p>
                                    </span>
                                    <p>If you are using non-volatile RAM, you can define a persistent variable with an initial value of zero loaded into RAM. The program can increment that variable over time as a counter, and that count will not disappear if the device loses power and restarts, because the memory is non-volatile and the boot routines do not initialize it back to zero. For example:</p>
                                    <code>#pragma PERSISTENT(x)
#pragma location = 0xC200 // memory address in RAM
int x = 0; 

void main() {
 run_init();

 while (1) {
 run_actions(x); 
 __delay_cycles(1000000); 
 x++;
 }
}</code>

                                    <p>The vector pragma requires linker command file support. The command file must specify output sections for each interrupt vector of the form .int<i>xx</i> where <i>xx</i> is the number of the interrupt vector. The output sections must map to the physical memory location of the appropriate interrupt vector. The standard linker command files are set up to handle the vector pragma. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="run-time-environment.html#SLAU1329506">Section 6.7.4</a></span>.</p>
                                    <p>If you do not specify an ISR routine for some interrupt vectors, an ISR routine will be provided for those vectors from the RTS library and the RTS library will automatically be linked with your application. The default ISR routine puts the device in low power mode. You can override the ISR provided by the RTS with the unused_interrupts keyword as follows:</p>
                                    <code>#pragma vector=unused_interrupts
interrupt void user_trap_function(void)

                                <p>The argument <i>string_literal</i> is interpreted in the same way the tokens following a #pragma directive are processed. The string_literal must be enclosed in quotes. A quotation mark that is part of the string_literal must be preceded by a backward slash.</p>
                                <p>You can use the _Pragma operator to express #pragma directives in macros. For example, the DATA_SECTION syntax:</p>

                                <p>An Application Binary Interface (ABI) defines how functions that are compiled or assembled separately (possibly by compilers from different vendors) can work together. This involves standardizing the data type representation, register conventions, and function structure and calling conventions. An ABI defines linkname generation from C symbol names. It defines the object file format and the debug format. It defines how the system is initialized. In the case of C++, it defines C++ name mangling and exception handling support.</p>
                                <p>The COFF ABI is not supported in v15.6.0.STS and later versions of the TI Code Generation Tools. If you would like to produce COFF output files, please use v4.4 of the MSP430 Code Generation Tools and refer to <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spru132J" target="_blank">SPRU132J</a> for documentation.</p>
                                <p>MSP430 uses the EABI ABI, wheich requires the ELF object file format. This format supports modern language features like early template instantiation and exporting inline functions.</p>
                                <p>TI-specific information on EABI mode is described in <span class="crossreference"><a href="run-time-environment.html#STDZ0549369">Section 6.9.3</a></span>.</p>
                                <p>To generate object files compatible with EABI, you must use MSP430 compiler version 4.0 or greater; see <span class="crossreference"><a href="using-the-c-c-compiler.html#STDZ0586x430">Section 2.13</a></span>. </p>
                                <p>The __TI_EABI__ predefined symbol is defined and set to 1 if compiling for EABI.</p>

                                <p>Each externally visible identifier is assigned a unique symbol name to be used in the object file, a so-called <i>linkname</i>. This name is assigned by the compiler according to an algorithm which depends on the name, type, and source language of the symbol. This algorithm may add a prefix to the identifier (typically an underscore), and it may <i>mangle</i> the name.</p>
                                <p>User-defined symbols in C code and in assembly code are in the same namespace, which means you are responsible for making sure that your C identifiers do not collide with your assembly code identifiers. You may have identifiers that collide with assembly keywords (for instance, register names); in this case, the compiler automatically uses an escape sequence to prevent the collision. The compiler escapes the identifier with double parallel bars, which instructs the assembler not to treat the identifier as a keyword. You are responsible for making sure that C identifiers do not collide with user-defined assembly code identifiers.</p>
                                <p>Name mangling encodes the types of the parameters of a function in the linkname for a function. Name mangling only occurs for C++ functions which are not declared 'extern "C"'. Mangling allows function overloading, operator overloading, and type-safe linking. Be aware that the return value of the function is not encoded in the mangled name, as C++ functions cannot be overloaded based on the return value. </p>
                                <p>For example, the general form of a C++ linkname for a function named func is:</p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>func__F</b>

                                <p>Where parmcodes is a sequence of letters that encodes the parameter types of func.</p>
                                <p>For this simple C++ source file:</p>
                                <code>int foo(int i){ } //global C++ function</code>
                                <p>This is the resulting assembly code:</p>
                                <code>foo__Fi</code>
                                <p>The linkname of foo is <span>foo__Fi</span>, indicating that foo is a function that takes a single argument of type int. To aid inspection and debugging, a name demangling utility is provided that demangles names into those found in the original C++ source. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="c-name-demangler.html#STDZ0516394">Section 8</a></span> for more information.</p>
                                <p>The mangling algorithm follows that described in the Itanium C++ ABI (<a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/abi.html" target="_blank">http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/abi.html</a>).</p>

                                    <p> Under relaxed ANSI/ISO mode (the default), the compiler accepts language extensions that could potentially conflict with a strictly conforming ANSI/ISO C/C++ program. Under strict ANSI mode, these language extensions are suppressed so that the compiler will accept all strictly conforming programs.</p>
                                    <p>Use the --strict_ansi option when you know your program is a conforming program and it will not compile in relaxed mode. In this mode, language extensions that conflict with ANSI/ISO C/C++ are disabled and the compiler will emit error messages where the standard requires it to do so. Violations that are considered discretionary by the standard may be emitted as warnings instead.</p>

To get the compiler to accept this code, use strict ANSI mode. The compiler will suppress the interrupt keyword language exception, and interrupt may then be used as an identifier in the code.</p>

                                    <p>For example, this function declaration uses the <b>alias</b> attribute to make "my_alias" a function alias for the "myFunc" function:</p>
                                    <code>void my_alias() __attribute__((alias("myFunc")));</code>
                                    <p>The <b>call_conv</b> attribute can be used to modify the calling conventions to allow both the IAR and TI compilers to link against the same ROM image. This function attribute allows functions compiled with the TI compiler to be linked with a ROM image generated by the IAR compiler. Note that the TI compiler does not generate ROM images.</p>
                                    <p>The call_conv attribute can be specified with "cc_rom" (for IAR/TI compatibility) or "cc_norm" (the default calling convention). Use "cc_rom" if you want to share a ROM image compiled with IAR. The following example uses the call_conv attribute in several ways:</p>
                                    <code>#define __cc_rom __attribute__((call_conv("cc_rom"))) 
 
__cc_rom void rom_func(void)
{
 ...
}

typedef __cc_rom void (rom_func_t)(void);
 
int main()
{
 rom_func();
 
 rom_func_t *fp = (rom_func_t*)0x1234; 
 fp();
 
 ((void (__cc_rom *)(void))0x2468)();
 
 void (__cc_rom *rom_func_ptr)(void); 
 rom_func_ptr = &amp;rom_func;
 rom_func_ptr();
}</code>
                                    <p>If you want IAR/TI compatibility with your calling conventions, be aware of the following restrictions on parameter passing. </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li id="t365168-20" value="1">All parameters combined must fit in registers. Registers may not be passed on the stack. </li>

                                    <p>The <b>format</b> attribute is applied to the declarations of printf, fprintf, sprintf, snprintf, vprintf, vfprintf, vsprintf, vsnprintf, scanf, fscanf, vfscanf, vscanf, vsscanf, and sscanf in stdio.h. Thus when GCC extensions are enabled, the data arguments of these functions are type checked against the format specifiers in the format string argument and warnings are issued when there is a mismatch. These warnings can be suppressed in the usual ways if they are not desired. </p>
                                    <p>See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0556804">Section 5.11.18</a></span> for more about using the <b>interrupt</b> function attribute.</p>
                                    <p>The <b>malloc</b> attribute is applied to the declarations of malloc, calloc, realloc and memalign in stdlib.h. </p>
                                    <p>The <b>ramfunc</b> attribute specifies that a function will be placed in and executed from RAM. The ramfunc attribute allows the compiler to optimize functions for RAM execution, as well as to automatically copy functions to RAM on flash-based devices. For example:</p>
                                    <code>__attribute__((ramfunc))
void f(void) {
 ... 
}
</code>
                                    <p>The --ramfunc=on option specifies that all functions compiled with this option are placed in and executed from RAM, even if this function attribute is not used.</p>
                                    <p>Newer TI linker command files support the ramfunc attribute automatically by placing functions with this attribute in the .TI.ramfunc section. If you have a linker command file that does not include a section specification for the .TI.ramfunc section, you can modify the linker command file to place this section in RAM. See the <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Placing_functions_in_RAM" target="_blank">Placing functions in RAM</a> wiki page for more about the ramfunc attribute and option. See the <i><span>MSP430 </span> Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i> for details on section placement.</p>

                                    <p>The <b>used</b> attribute is defined in GCC 4.2 (see <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.2.4/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html#Variable-Attributes" target="_blank">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.2.4/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html#Variable-Attributes</a>).</p>
                                    <p>In addition, the <b>packed</b> attribute may be applied to individual fields within a struct or union.

                                        <span class="section-label">5.16.4 </span>Type Attributes</h4>
                                    <p>The following type attributes are supported: aligned, deprecated, <span>packed, </span>transparent_union, <span>and unused</span>.</p>
                                    <p>The <b>packed</b> attribute is supported for struct and union types if the --relaxed_ansi option is used.</p>
                                    <p>Members of a packed structure are stored as closely to each other as possible, omitting additional bytes of padding usually added to preserve word-alignment. For example, assuming a word-size of 4 bytes ordinarily has 3 bytes of padding between members c1 and i, and another 3 bytes of trailing padding after member c2, leading to a total size of 12 bytes:</p>
                                    <code>    struct unpacked_struct { char c1; int i; char c2;}; </code>
                                    <p> However, the members of a packed struct are byte-aligned. Thus the following does not have any bytes of padding between or after members and totals 6 bytes:</p>
                                    <code>   struct __attribute__((__packed__)) packed_struct { char c1; int i; char c2; };</code>
                                    <p>Subsequently, packed structures in an array are packed together without trailing padding between array elements.</p>
                                    <p>Bit fields of a packed structure are bit-aligned. The byte alignment of adjacent struct members that are not bit fields does not change. However, there are no bits of padding between adjacent bit fields. </p>
                                    <p>The <b>packed</b> attribute can only be applied to the original definition of a structure or union type. It cannot be applied with a typedef to a non-packed structure that has already been defined, nor can it be applied to the declaration of a struct or union object. Therefore, any given structure or union type can only be packed or non-packed, and all objects of that type will inherit its packed or non-packed attribute.</p>
                                    <p>The packed attribute is not applied recursively to structure types that are contained within a packed structure. Thus, in the following example the member s retains the same internal layout as in the first example above. There is no padding between c and s, so s falls on an unaligned boundary: </p>
                                    <code>   struct __attribute__((__packed__)) outer_packed_struct { char c; struct unpacked_struct s; };</code>
                                    <p>It is illegal to implicitly or explicitly cast the address of a packed struct member as a pointer to any non-packed type except an unsigned char. In the following example, p1, p2, and the call to foo are all illegal. </p>
                                    <code>   void foo(int *param);
 struct packed_struct ps;

 int *p1 = &amp;ps.i;
 int *p2 = (int *)&amp;ps.i;
 foo(&amp;ps.i);</code>
                                    <p>However, it is legal to explicitly cast the address of a packed struct member as a pointer to an unsigned char:</p>
                                    <code>   unsigned char *pc = (unsigned char *)&amp;ps.i;
</code>
                                    <p>The packed attribute can also be applied to enumerated types. On an enum, packed indicates that the smallest integral type should be used.</p>
                                    <p>The TI compiler also supports an <b>unpacked</b> attribute for an enumeration type to allow you to indicate that the representation is to be an integer type that is no smaller than int; in other words, it is not <i>packed</i>. </p>

                                <p>Due to the variety of host systems supported by the C/C++ compiler and the limitations of some of these systems, the compiler may not be able to successfully compile source files that are excessively large or complex. In general, exceeding such a system limit prevents continued compilation, so the compiler aborts immediately after printing the error message. Simplify the program to avoid exceeding a system limit.</p>
                                <p>Some systems do not allow filenames longer than 500 characters. Make sure your filenames are shorter than 500.</p>
                                <p>The compiler has no arbitrary limits but is limited by the amount of memory available on the host system. On smaller host systems such as PCs, the optimizer may run out of memory. If this occurs, the optimizer terminates and the shell continues compiling the file with the code generator. This results in a file compiled with no optimization. The optimizer compiles one function at a time, so the most likely cause of this is a large or extremely complex function in your source module. To correct the problem, your options are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">Don't optimize the module in question.</li>
                                    <li value="2">Identify the function that caused the problem and break it down into smaller functions.</li>
                                    <li value="3">Extract the function from the module and place it in a separate module that can be compiled without optimization so that the remaining functions can be optimized.</li>
