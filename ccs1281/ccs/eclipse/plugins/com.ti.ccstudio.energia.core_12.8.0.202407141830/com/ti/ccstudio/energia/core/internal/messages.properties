energiaCoreInitializer_msg_dirNotFound = The specified directory cannot be found or is not a directory.
energiaCoreInitializer_msg_dirNotValid = The specified directory does not resemble an Energia install. Please select the directory containing the 'energia' executable.
energiaCoreInitializer_msg_untestedVersion = This Energia install is newer than the latest Energia build tested with CCS - {0}. For best results please use Energia {0}, or upgrade to a newer version of CCS, if available.
energiaCoreInitializer_msg_pathWithSpaces = It is recommended that Energia is installed in a path containing no spaces, as some projects may not build as expected.

sketchImporter_msg_noCompiler = No {0} compiler tools are currently available for ''{1}''. Please go to Preferences > CCS > Build > Compilers, and add a {0} compiler for this device-family.
sketchImporter_msg_fileNotFound = The selected path cannot be found or is not a file.
sketchImporter_msg_energiaNotRegistered = Energia must be registered with CCS before importing sketches. Go to 'Preferences > Code Composer Studio > Products' to register.
sketchImporter_msg_energiaVersionNotAvailable = Version ''{0}'' of Energia is not currently registered with CCS, and no compatible version is available. Go to 'Preferences > Code Composer Studio > Products' to register.
sketchImporter_msg_badBoardId = The board-ID ''{0}'' is not recognized. It is either invalid, or is not supported by Energia v{1}.
sketchImporter_msg_notEnergiaProject = Project ''{0}'' is not an Energia executable project!
sketchImporter_msg_boardNotDetermined = The board for project ''{0}'' cannot be determined!

buildDelegate_msg_energiaNotRegistered = Energia must be registered with CCS before building sketch projects. Go to 'Preferences > Code Composer Studio > Products' to register.
buildDelegate_msg_energiaVersionNotAvailable = This project was created with Energia v{0}, which is not currently installed and no compatible version is available. Go to 'Preferences > Code Composer Studio > Products' to register a compatible version of Energia.
buildDelegate_msg_oldEnergiaInstall = This project was created with Energia v{0}, which is newer than the build you are currently using (v{1}). Please consider upgrading to the newer Energia build to ensure all projects build as expected.
buildDelegate_msg_badBoardId = The board-ID ''{0}'' is not recognized. It is either invalid, or is not supported by Energia v{1}.
buildDelegate_msg_unqualifiedFunctions = Multiple sketch files, defining unqualified 'setup' and 'loop' functions, detected! This project may still build successfully, but source-navigation and debugging may be affected. Please consider adding a unique suffix to each 'setup' and 'loop' function-pair.

sketchPreprocessor_msg_badStringLiteral = Un-terminated string literal detected during code-generation!
sketchPreprocessor_msg_badComment = Un-terminated /* comment */ detected during code-generation!
