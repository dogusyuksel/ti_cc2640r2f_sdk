EnergyTrace&#x2122; Technology supports energy aware debugging. The device's CPU runtime, voltage and current will be captured and analyzed. The results can be used to optimize target program for ultra-lower power consumption.

The CPU runtime and energy usage summary is shown in Profile view. The captured live data can also be compared to a saved reference data set. The percentage differences are shown in additional columns.

Other views are available to show the time based graph of Power, Energy and Device Status. With these graphs, the system execution and power usage can be examined in details.

For further information, please refer to the following documents.
