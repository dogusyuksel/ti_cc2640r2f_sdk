<span style="background:#ffffff"> EnergyTrace&trade; Technology</span>
</h4>
<h5>
<span style="background:#ffffff">Introduction</span>
</h5>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">EnteryTrace&trade; Technology is an energy-based code
			analysis tool that measures and displays the application&rsquo;s energy profile and helps to optimize it
			for ultra-low power consumption. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">MSP432 devices with built-in <b>EnergyTrace+[CPU State]</b> (or in short <b> EnergyTrace+</b>) technology allow real-time monitoring of many
			internal device states while user program code executes. EnergyTrace+ technology is supported on
			selected MSP432 devices and debuggers.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff"> <b>EnergyTrace</b> mode (without the "+") is the base of
			<b>EnergyTrace Technology</b> and enables analog energy measurement to
			determine the energy consumption of an application but does not correlate it to internal device
			information. The EnergyTrace mode is available for all MSP432 devices with selected debuggers,
			including CCS.</span>
</p>



<h5>
<span style="background:#ffffff">Energy Measurement</span>
</h5>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">Debuggers with EnergyTrace Technology support include a new and unique way of
			continuously measuring the energy supplied to a target microcontroller that differs considerably
			from the well-known method of amplifying and sampling the voltage drop over a shunt resistor at
			discrete times. A software-controlled dc-dc converter is used to generate the target power supply.
			The time density of the dc-dc converter charge pulses equals the energy consumption of the target
			microcontroller. A built-in on-the-fly calibration circuit defines the energy equivalent of a
			single dc-dc charge pulse. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff"><sup>(#SLAU1578796719)</sup> shows the energy measurement principle. Periods with a small number of
			charge pulses per time unit indicate low energy consumption and thus low current flow. Periods with
			a high number of charge pulses per time unit indicate high energy consumption and also a high
			current consumption. Each charge pulse leads to a rise of the output voltage
			V<sub><span style="background:#ffffff">OUT</span></sub>, which results in an unavoidable voltage ripple common to all dc-dc
			converters. </span>
</p>

<p align="center">
<B><span style="background:#ffffff">Pulse Density and
			  Current Flow</span></B>
</p>


<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">The benefit of sampling continuously is evident: even the shortest device activity that
			consumes energy contributes to the overall recorded energy. No shunt-based measurement system can
			achieve this. </span>
</p>



<h5>
<span style="background:#ffffff">Code Composer Studio&trade; Integration</span>
</h5>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">EnergyTrace Technology is available as part of Texas Instrument's Code Composer Studio
			IDE for MSP432 microcontrollers. During debugging of an application, additional windows are
			available if the hardware supports EnergyTrace Technology. </span>
</p>


<h5>
<span style="background:#ffffff">Enabling EnergyTrace Technology and
			  Selecting the Default Mode</span>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">By default, the EnergyTrace Technology feature is disabled in the Code Composer
			  Studio Preferences. To enable it, go to Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Code Composer Studio &rarr; Advanced
			  Tools &rarr; EnergyTrace&trade; Technology (see <sup>(#SLAU1578796765)</sup>).</span>

<h5>
<span style="background:#ffffff">Comparing Captured Data With Reference
			  Data</span>
</h5>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">The EnergyTrace Technology can be used in various ways. One is to check the device's
			  internal states over time against the expected behavior and correct any misbehavior; for example,
			  due to a peripheral not being disabled after periodic usage. Another way is to compare the captured
			  data against previously captured data. The previously captured data is called the
			  <i>reference data</i> in the following discussion. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">After the reference data has been loaded, a yellow reference graph is plotted in the
			  Power and Energy windows. The Power window shows the power profiles of both data sets over time and
			  is useful to determine any changes in static power consumption; for example, due to use of a deeper
			  low-power mode or disabling of unused peripherals. It also shows how the dynamic power consumption
			  has changed from one measurement to the other; for example, due to ULP Advisor hints being
			  implemented. The Energy window shows the accumulated energy consumption over time and gives an
			  indication which profile is more energy efficient. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">In the <b>EnergyTrace+</b> mode, the condensed view of
			  both captured and reference data is displayed in the Profile window (see <sup>(#SLAU15787961334)</sup>). You can quickly see how the overall energy consumption and use of power
			  modes, peripherals, and clocks changed between both capture sessions. In general, parameters that
			  have become better are shown with a green bar, and parameters that have become worse are shown with
			  a red bar. For example, time spent in Active Mode is generally seen as negative. Hence, if a code
			  change makes the application spend less time in active mode, the negative delta is shown as a green
			  bar, and the additional time spent in a low-power mode is shown as a green bar.</span>

<h5>
<span style="background:#ffffff">EnergyTrace Technology FAQs</span>
</h5>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff"> <i>Q: What is the sampling frequency of EnergyTrace+
			technology?</i> </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">Updated the answer to the
			first question in <sup>(#SLAU1571290)</sup>A: The sampling frequency depends on the debugger and the selected
			debug protocol and its speed setting. It typically ranges from 1&nbsp;kHz (for example, when using the
			Spy-Bi-Wire interface set to SLOW) up to 3.2&nbsp;kHz (for example, when using the JTAG interface set to
			FAST). The debugger polls the state information of EnergyTrace+ from the device status
			information. Depending on the sampling frequency, a short or fast duty cycle active peripheral
			state may not be captured on the State graph. In addition, the higher sampling frequency affects
			the device energy consumption under EnergyTrace.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">Added the second question in <sup>(#SLAU1571290)</sup><i>Q: What is the sampling frequency of
			EnergyTrace technology?</i></span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">A: The sampling frequency to measure the energy consumption is the same independent of
			which debug protocol or speed and is approximately 4.2&nbsp;kHz in Free Run mode.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff"> <i>Q: My Power graph seems to include noise. Is my board
			defective?</i> </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">A: The power values shown in the Power graph are derived (that is, calculated) from the
			accumulated energy counted by the measurement system. When the target is consuming little energy, a
			small number of energy packets over time are supplied to the target, and the software needs to
			accumulate the dc-dc charge pulses over time before a new current value can be calculated. For
			currents under 1 &micro;A, this can take up to one second, while for currents in the milliamp range, a
			current can be calculated every millisecond. Additional filtering is not applied so that detail
			information is not lost. Another factor that affects the energy (and with it, the current) that is
			consumed by the target is periodic background debug access during normal code execution, either
			through capturing of States information or through breakpoint polling. Try recording in Free Run
			mode to see a much smoother Power graph.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff"> <i>Q: I have a code that repeatedly calls functions
			that have the same size. I would expect the function profile to show an equal distribution of the
			run time. In reality, I see some functions having slightly more run time than expected, and some
			functions slightly less.</i> </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">A: During program counter trace, various factors affect the number of times a function
			is detected by the profiler over time. The microcontroller code could benefit from the internal
			cache, thus executing some functions faster than others. Another influencing factor is memory wait
			states and CPU pipeline stalls, which add time variance to the code execution. An outside factor is
			the sampling frequency of the debugger itself, which normally runs asynchronous to the
			microcontroller's code execution speed, but in some cases shows overlapping behavior, which also
			results in an unequal function run time distribution. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff"> <i>Q: My profile sometimes includes an &lt;Undetermined&gt;
			low-power mode, and there are gaps in the States graph Power Mode section. Where does the
			&lt;Undetermined&gt; low-power mode originate from?</i> </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">A: During transitions from active mode to low-power mode, internal device clocks are
			switched off, and occasionally the state information is not updated completely. This state is
			displayed as &lt;Undetermined&gt; in the Profile window, and the States graph shows a gap during
			the time that the &lt;Undetermined&gt; low-power mode persists. The &lt;Undetermined&gt; state is
			an indication that your application has entered a low-power mode, but which mode cannot be
			accurately determined. If your application is frequently entering low-power modes, the
			&lt;Undetermined&gt; state will probably be shown more often than if your application only rarely
			uses low-power modes. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff"> <i>Q: When capturing in EnergyTrace mode, the min and max values
			for power and current show deviation, even though my program is the same. I would expect absolutely
			the same values.</i> </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">A: The energy measurement method used on the hardware counts dc-dc charge pulses over
			time. Energy and power are calculated from the energy over time. Due to statistical sampling
			effects and charge and discharge effects of the output voltage buffer capacitors, it is possible
			that minimum and maximum values of currents vary by some percent, even though the program is
			identical. The captured energy, however, should be almost equal (in the given accuracy
			range).</span>

<span style="background:#ffffff"> <i>Q: What are the influencing factors for the accuracy of the
			energy measurement?</i> </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">A: The energy measurement circuit is directly supplied from the USB bus voltage, and
			thus it is sensitive to USB bus voltage variations. During calibration, the energy equivalent of a
			single dc-dc charge pulse is defined, and this energy equivalent depends on the USB voltage level.
			To ensure a good repeatability and accuracy, power the debugger directly from an active USB port,
			and avoid using bus-powered hubs and long USB cables that can lead to voltage drops, especially
			when other consumers are connected to the USB hub. Furthermore the LDO and resistors used for
			reference voltage generation and those in the calibration circuit come with a certain tolerance and
			ppm rate over temperature, which also influences accuracy of the energy measurement. </span>

<span style="background:#ffffff"> <i>Q: I am trying to capture in EnergyTrace+ mode or EnergyTrace
			mode with a MSP432 device that is externally powered, but there is no data shown in the Profile,
			Energy, Power and States window.</i> </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">A: Both EnergyTrace+ mode and EnergyTrace mode require the target to be supplied from
			the debugger. No data can be captured when the target microcontroller is externally powered.</span>
</p>


<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff"> <i>Q: I cannot measure LPM currents when I am capturing in
			EnergyTrace+ mode. I am expecting a few microamps but measure more than 150 &micro;A. </i>
			</span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">A: Reading digital data from the target microcontroller consumes energy in the JTAG
			domain of the microcontroller. Hence, an average current of approximately 150 &micro;A is measured when
			connecting an ampere meter to the device power supply pins. If you want to eliminate energy
			consumption through debug communication, switch to EnergyTrace mode, and let the target
			microcontroller execute in Free Run mode. </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff"> <i>Q: My LPM currents seem to be wrong. I am expecting a few
			microamps, but measure more, even in Free Run mode or when letting the device execute without debug
			control from an independent power supply. </i> </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">A: The most likely cause of this extra current is improper GPIO termination, as
			floating pins can lead to extra current flow. Also check the JTAG pins again, especially when the
			debugger is still connected (but idle), as the debugger output signal levels in idle state might
			not match how the JTAG pins have been configured by the application code. This could also lead to
			extra current flow. </span>

<span style="background:#ffffff"> <i>Q: When I start the EnergyTrace+ windows through View &rarr; Other
			&rarr; EnergyTrace before launching the debug session, data capture sometimes does not start.
			</i> </span>
</p>

<p>
<span style="background:#ffffff">A: Enable EnergyTrace through Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Code Composer Studio &rarr; Advanced
			Tools &rarr; EnergyTrace&trade; Technology. When launching a debug session, the EnergyTrace+ windows
			automatically open, and data capture starts when the device executes. If you accidentally close all
			EnergyTrace+ windows during a debug session, you can reopen them through View &rarr; Other &rarr;
			EnergyTrace. </span>
