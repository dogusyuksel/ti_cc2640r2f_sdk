**Power supply requirements:**

The LaunchPad is designed to be powered from a USB-compliant power source, either a USB charger or a computer. When used this way, jumpers need to be mounted on the 3V3 position of the central jumper block. An LDO powered from the USB VBUS supply supplies 3.3V to the XDS debugger, the CC1310, and associated circuitry including the 3V3-marked pins for BoosterPacks.

**Temperature range:**

The LaunchPad is designed for operation -25 to +70 C. Note that other BoosterPacks and LaunchPads may have different temperature ranges, and when combined, the combination will be set by the most restrictive combined range.">
