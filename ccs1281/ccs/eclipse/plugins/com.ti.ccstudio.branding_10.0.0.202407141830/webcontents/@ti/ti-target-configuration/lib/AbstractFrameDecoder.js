/**
 * Abstract class for a packet frame decoder.  A frame decoder is used to detect/align the start of packets
 * in a stream of data received over a transport like USB.  The derived class must implement the getPacketLength()
 * method to validate and calculate the length of each possible packet of data.  The base implementations of decode()
 * method will repeatedly call this method to test for possible packets.  Optionally, the derived class can provide
 * a start byte, which the base implementation will use to skip past packets that do not start with the exact byte
 * automatically.
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param {Number} [startByte] - the first byte used to identify the start of a packet header.
