/**
 * Abstract class that provides default implementation of IBindFactory for a polling data model.  This class
 * provides a "$refresh_interval" binding can be used to control the polling interval any bindings that are created.
 * Alternatively, each binding could have it's own polling interval as needed.  The $refresh_interval is available
 * to app developers so that they could allow end users to control the polling interval.  The refresh interval represents
 * a delay between polling cycles, and does not reflect real time constraints.  This way if refresh interval is too short
 * it doesn't backlog polling operations, instead it simply polls as fast as possible.
 *

 * @extends gc.databind.AbstractBindFactory
