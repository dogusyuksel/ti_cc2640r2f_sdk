/**
 * Class that implements IProgressCounter interface to count progress.
 * This class is constructed with a
 * callback that will be called when the progress reaches 100%.
 * A single initial job is added to the progress counter automatically.
 * in the constructor.
 * As a result, the client must call IProgressCounter.done() once to
 * complete the job.  Typically, the client will pass this object
 * around to other parties who may or may not add their own jobs
 * to the progress counter.  Only when all jobs are completed will
 * the client recieve the callback.
