<h1>DVT Graph Channels</h1>

<p class="para">
We call the lines that are plotted horizontally a Channel however this might or might not map to an
actual channel. 
</p>

<h3>Presentation</h3>
<br/>Each channel can be presented on the Y-Axis in any of the following forms: 
<ul>
<li><b>State:</b> Where data in the channel are drawn same way as our original  State Graph 
</li><li><b>Shape:</b> Good for event visualization, where data points in channels are drawn as Circle/Line/Triangle/Square/... 
</li><li><b>Icon:</b> Same as Shape, this is good for event visualization. 
</li><li><b>Message:</b> Good for presentation of long string messages where an "M" icon is drawn and text of message is shown as a tooltip on mouse-over.(Default) 
</li><li><b>Value:</b> Similar to VCD where for each value change, a new hexagonal is drawn and the value is presented inside the hexagonal. 
</li><li><b>Waveform:</b> Plotted as a a 0/1 digital step waveform.</li>
</ul>

<h3>State/Event Categories</h3>
<br/>
Color/shape/icon assignments for "State", "Shape", "Icon" presentation types, can be controlled using the <b>State/Event Categories</b>
and assigning the proper category to the channel.

<h3>Exapnd</h3>
<br/>
For State, Shape and Icon display formats, clicking on the channel name on Y-Axis, will expand the channel into possible states/events on separate lines, s
imilar to to DVT's old Discrete Graph. You may control expanding for the supported types using the <b>Expand</b> checkbox. 

<h3>Visiblity</h3>
<br/>
Channel visibility may also be controlled by using the <b>Visible</b> checkbox.

<h3>Annotation</h3>
<br/>
Annotations can be added to the what gets drawn on DVT Graph globally or per channel. The correspoinding value of the field
that user selects, for the same record, will show up underneath the point.

<h3>Tooltip</h3>
<br/>Tooltips are supported on mouse-over on states/events by default but user may also add any additional tooltips they'd like to get displayed along with the defaults as well.

<h3>Alias</h3>
<br/>If user wants to show a different channel name than the one that is autodiscoverred from the data stream, they could specify an
<b>Alias</b>. And if the alias, contains the tree/hierarchical mode separator charactor (default '.'), when switched to tree mode, the channel
would show up under the proper hierarchy in the tree.

<h3>Toolbar</h3>
<br/>Channels may also be removed or re-orderred using the icons on the toolbar, and when there are too many channels, user may use "Search Channel Name" text box and as s/he types in, 
user can drill down to the channel s/he would like to configure. Multi selection to apply same changes on more than one channel is also
supported both in tree mode and flat mode.
