<h1>DVT Graph State/Event Categories</h1>

<p class="para">
<br/>Some presentation types like <b>State</b>, <b>Shape</b>, <b>Icon</b> need color, shape or icon assignment based on the value of the field. 
The color/shape/icon settings can also be categorized so different channel use the same color scheme or use different ones.

<br/>Although a valid use case is that end user to come up with all the color/shape/icon and category assignments manually. 
This task however might easily get out of control because in most cases, we might not know what the possible categories and 
color assignment shall be especially if the data collection is handled with any data source that might not even exist today. 
So we've came up with a scheme that hopefully addresses this a combination of manual and autodiscover cases with some control 
over the color/shape/icons for a the known set of state values.
 
<br/>To specify the known set of state values, delete all categories other than <b>Main</b> category and specify visibility, color, shap, icon settings
for each state/event. This will serve as the <b>default</b> setting for autodiscoverred categories.

<h3>Event/State Name</h3>
<br/>When autodiscovery/autoassign is enabled for categories, each channel that with "State", "Shape", or "Icon" presentation type,
is listed as a category and the values within that channel, would be listed as valid states. All the possible states of the system
also get listed under the <b>Main</b> category.

<h3>Visibility</h3>
<br/>Control whether or not show a state using the "Visible" checkbox.

<h3>Color</h3>
<br/>Configure what color to use for each state within a category

<h3>Shape</h3>
<br/>Configure what shape to use for each state, the shapes will be colored using the specified color for the state/event. 
Here are the supported shapes:
<ul>
<li>Circle</li>
<li>Line</li> - Line is different with other shapes in that a vertical line crossing all channel (which will be a two pixels thicker on 
		the channel that is responsible for drawing), will be plotted. This comes handy for inserting markers that for example could
		mark start of frames.
<li>Triangle</li>
<li>Square</li>
<li>Arrow</li>
<li>Alphabet<li> - Shows the first character of state inside a circle shaped border
</ul>

<h3>Icon</h3>
<br/>The list of shapes that the graph supports is limited to the above list however user may easily add any icons they'd like to see by
dropping the icon file to &lt;install_dir&gt;\dvt\icons and modifying state_icon.txt. Restarting the tool and assigning their icon
name to the state.

<h3>Toolbar</h3>
<br/>Multi Select assignment and drilling down based on channel name works the same way as "Channels" tab.
