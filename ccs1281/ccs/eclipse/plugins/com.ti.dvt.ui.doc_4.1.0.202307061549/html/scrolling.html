<h1>Cursor and Scroll Lock</h1>
<p class="para">
Data views scroll to the very end when new data is received, if user spots a point of interest in the view while data is updating, clicking on the graph or table, will stop the automatic scroll to the end and stays where user has clicked / cursor position, while data continues to get appended to the end.

<br/><br/>To continue scrolling to the end, so that cursor position gets updated whenever new data is received, toggle off the <img src="images/scroll_lock.png" border="0" /> scroll lock button on the toolbar.

<br/><br/>Please note, if grouping on data views is enabled (the group button on the toolbar: <img src="images/group_couple.gif" border="0" /> is toggled on), data views will scroll synchronously however the scroll lock currently works independently of the group and will not lock the scrolling of grouped views.

<br/><br/>Use the <img src="images/freeze_data_updates.gif" border="0" /> Freeze button on the toolbar, to freeze the data updates and automatic refresh of the data views completely.
