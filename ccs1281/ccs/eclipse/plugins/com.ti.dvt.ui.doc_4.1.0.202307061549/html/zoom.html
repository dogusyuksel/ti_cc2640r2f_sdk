<h1>Zooming</h1>
<p class="para">
Zooming is only available on graphs. You can zoom in both X-Axis and Y-Axis in <img src="images/line.gif" border="0"/> <a href="DVT_concepts/graphs/line_graph.htm">Line Graph</a> while for <img src="images/dvt_graph.gif" border="0"/> <a href="DVT_concepts/graphs/dvt_graph.htm">DVT Graph</a>, you may only use the zoom on the X-Axis.

Zoom feature can be used by any of these methods:
</p>

<h3>Using Mouse</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use <b>ALT_Mouse Drag</b> to select any area on the graph to Zoom-In</li>
<li>Also <b>Mouse Drag</b> by itself on the axis areas (without holding the ALT key) would provide Zoom-In on the selected area</li>
<li>You may also use <b>Scroll-Wheel</b> on the X-axis areas for Zooming-In as well as Zooming-Out </li>
</ul>

<h3>Using Keyboard</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>CTRL_+</b> to Zoom-In</li>
<li><b>CTRL_-</b> to Zoom-Out</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using View Toolbar</h3>

<ul>
<li><img src="images/zoomin.gif" border="0"/>: The Zoom In button on toolbar increases the graph resolution to provide more detail by the set zoom factor and zoom directions. </li>
<li><img src="images/zoomout.gif" border="0"/>: The Zoom Out button to decrease graph resolution and see more data using the set zoom factor and zoom directions. </li>
<li><img src="images/zoom_options.gif" border="0"/>: Use this to reset the zoom for the graph (return to original zoom factor and orientation). Use the drop-down selection arrow next to the button to </li>
<li><img src="images/zoom_axisresolution_options.png" border="0"/>: With the dropdown right next to Reset Zoom, known as zoom options dropdown, you can specify the zoom factor and directions of the zoom for line graph:
<ul><li><img src="images/zoomin_horz.gif" border="0"/>: Horizontal zoom</li>
    <li><img src="images/zoomin_vert.gif" border="0"/>: Vertical zoom</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="para">
<b>Note:</b> When keyboard, scroll-wheel or toolbar buttons are used for zooming, the cursor position is used as a point of reference to apply zoom, and when no cursor position is found, the center of the graph is used. 
<br/><br/>To set the cursor position, simply click on the point of interest on the graph area, this will leave behind a red line (or cross-hair) which will get used for zooming.
