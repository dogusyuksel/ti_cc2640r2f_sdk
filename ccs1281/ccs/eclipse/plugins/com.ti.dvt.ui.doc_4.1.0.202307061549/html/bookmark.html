<h1>Bookmark</h1>
<p class="para">
Use <img src="images/bookmark_add.gif" border="0" /> to create a bookmark on any data points of graph or table. The bookmark will be presented as a vertical red dashed line on the graph or a row with red background color on the table and an ID gets assigned to it.
<br/>
<br/>
You can use the dropdown under <img src="images/bookmark_add.gif" border="0" /> to recall and move the focus back to the previously created bookmark later on (Note: Bookmarks currently are created and work on the data view only and not in a group of data views)
<br/>
<br/>

To rename or delete bookmark, use the very last option in the drop-down: <b>"Manage The BookMarks"</b>
