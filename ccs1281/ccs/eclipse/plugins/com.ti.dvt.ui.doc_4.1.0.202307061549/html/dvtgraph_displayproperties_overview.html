<h1>DVT Graph 'Display Properties'</h1>
<p class="para">
With DVT Graph state transitions, events, messages and values that are grouped in channels in 
horizontal lines on y-axis are plotted against time or some other sequence on x-axis.  
</p> 
<p class="para">
Normally DVT solution builder configures what data field values
(from the connected buffer to the view), should be used for x-axis and y-axis of this graph, and
how things get auto-discoverred.
End users can alway access these properties using 
<a href="http://help.eclipse.org/help32/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/reference/ref-29.htm">eclipse' standard Properties View</a>, however the 
amount of Properties that can be configured on the advanced properties might overwhelm end users and
they are not presented the way most suited for end users.
</p>

<p class="para">
End users usually would like to modify the display properties of the auto-discoverred entities, 
things like what color, icon, shape or display format should be used for each channel. Display
properties of DVT Graph enables users to perform these operations while hiding the complexity of
advanced properties. Also, any changes that end users make, overrides the standard autodiscoverred 
properties.
</p>


<p class="para">
On the 'Display Properties' dialog, you may configure three sets of properties, each presented 
in its own tab:
<ul>
<li><a href="dvtgraph_displayproperties_channels.html">Channels</a></li>
<li><a href="dvtgraph_displayproperties_categories.html">State/Event Categories</a></li>
<li><a href="dvtgraph_displayproperties_appearance.html">Appearance</a></li>
</ul>
Three buttons, apply, ok and cancel, enables users to apply their changes without closing the dialog or 
cancel any changes that are made.
