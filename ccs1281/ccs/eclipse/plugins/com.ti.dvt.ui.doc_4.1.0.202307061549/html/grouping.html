<h1>Groups and Synchronous Scrolling</h1>
<p class="para">
Data views can be grouped together based on common referece value usually on something like Time values, this will allow <b>synchronous scrolling</b> of the grouped views together to easily find and navigate between interesting points in the graph and the corresponding details for that same point in a table view for example. 

<br/><br/>To enable grouping, toggle on the group button on the toolbar: <img src="images/group_couple.gif" border="0" /> and simply move the cursor in a grouped table or on a graph as you normally would by clicking on the graph.

<br/><br/>For the graphs the X-Axis is used for the common reference value but for Tables the reference column can be defined. Also more than one view group can be defined for more information about creating and managing groups, can be found here: <a href="DVT_tasks/synchronizingTablesGraphs/managing_groups.htm">Managing Groups</a>
