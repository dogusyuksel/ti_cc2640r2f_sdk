When importing many of the examples from a SimpleLink SDK you end up with an application project and a kernel project in your workspace.  If you import a second example only the application project will be imported and both of them will depend on the same kernel project.

This article shows how you can have different projects use different versions of the SDK.

### Copy the kernel project ###
The first step is to copy the kernel project.  Select the kernel project in **Project Explorer** and open the context menu.  Select **Copy**.

Now click anywhere in the Project Explorer and Paste.  This will open a dialog box prompting for a name for the project.

Make sure to give the project a name without spaces in it to avoid build issues.  One suggestion is to put the SDK version in the name so that you can easily identify it.

You will now have multiple kernel projects in your workspace.

### Change SDK version ###
Now change the version of the SDK that the new kernel project references.

There are more details available on changing SDK versions in this quicktip article: [Changing the SimpleLink SDK version used by a Project](ccs_update_simplelink_sdk.html "Changing the SimpleLink SDK version used by a Project")

### Setting dependencies ###
Now we can change one of our application projects to depend on the new kernel project.

Select one of the application projects in **Project Explorer**.  From the **Project** menu select Properties.

Click on **Build** in the tree on the left and then select the **Dependencies** tab on the right.

Select the kernel project that is currently referenced and the click the **Remove** button to remove the existing dependency.

Now click on the **Add** button and check the box next to the new kernel project.

Next change the **Referenced Build-configuration** value to be active.

Note that if you are using multiple build configurations such as Debug and Release you will need to repeat these steps for the other configurations by selecting them via the configuration selection drop-down.

Now this application project is setup to reference the new kernel project.
