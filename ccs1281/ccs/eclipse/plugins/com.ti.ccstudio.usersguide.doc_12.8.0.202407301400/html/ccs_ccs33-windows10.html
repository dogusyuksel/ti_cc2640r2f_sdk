## Overview

CCS 3.3 was released in 2006, with the last update for it being released in 2009. The last version of Windows officially supported by CCS 3.3 was Windows XP-32. Given that both CCS 3.3 and Windows XP are no longer supported by TI and Microsoft (respectively), customers are recommended against using CCS 3.3. However, there may be circumstances where a customer will have no choice but to continue usage of CCS 3.3 - such as supporting legacy products. In such cases, we strongly recommend keeping a native Windows XP-32 machine to run it on. This can be a risky proposition for many IT departments since Windows XP-32 has not been supported by Microsoft in quite some time. The next best option is to run Windows XP-32 from a virtual machine. This will satisfy some customers, but there are still many users who prefer running CCS 3.3 on a native (and more current) Windows environment. It is possible to install CCS 3.3 on more current Windows environments like Windows 10, but there are many caveats to this approach. This document will focus on them, in addition to providing any available workarounds.

## Requirements

[[y Administrator Privileges Required!
CCS 3.3 *must be installed and run with administrator privileges*. If you do not have the ability to run applications with administrator privileges on your PC, then you will *not* be able to effectively install and run CCS 3.3. 
]]

## Installation

After downloading and extracting the [CCS 3.3 install package](http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_ccstudio/CCSv3/CCS_3_3/exports/CCS_3.3.83.20_Platinum.zip), look for the <tt>setup.exe</tt> file in the extracted folder. Run the executable *as an administrator* to install CCS 3.3:

![](./images/ccs33_win10_00.png)

Follow the steps in the install wizard. Near the end of the installation, several popup errors will appear. This is expected on Windows 10. For the first two **Error 1920** errors, select the option to **Ignore** them.

For the third **DevCon** error, simply ignore it by selecting **OK**:

The next popup will be a Warning regarding **CCS Scripting**. This warning will always appear regardless of which Windows version you are using. Just press **OK** to continue:

The installation should now be complete.

## Debug Probes (Emulators)

If you are just planning on using the bundled simulators in CCS 3.3, then you are all set to go. But assuming you would like to use CCS with actual hardware, then there will be some additional considerations required. CCS 3.3 comes bundled with drivers for [XDS100](https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/xdsdebugprobes/emu_xds100.html), XDS510 ISA card, and XDS560 PCI card. The latter two are quite uncommon these days, especially the XDS510 ISA. Note that the XDS100 drivers that come with CCS 3.3 is only for the XDS100v1. XDS100v2 (and greater) are not supported by CCS 3.3.

Most CCS 3.3 users often used an older 3rd party debug probes, such as ones from Spectrum Digital or Blackhawk. If you plan on using a 3rd party debug probe, please obtain the driver directly from them. Assuming you have a 64-bit version of Windows 10, you must check with them to make sure that their latest drivers for CCS 3.3 will work on 64-bit systems. The old Spectrum Digital XDS510 USB was quite popular with CCS 3.3 user and the [latest drivers for the XDS510 USB](https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/non-esd/spectrum/setupCCSPlatinum_v30330.ZIP) do support 64-bit systems. 

It is likely that you will need to install these 3rd party drivers as administrator, just like with CCS 3.3.

[[y  Spectrum Digital Drivers
Simply having the permissions to run the Spectrum Digital installer with administrator privileges may not enough for a successful installation. In this case, the user account must be given *full administrator rights* to complete the installation.

## Running CCS 3.3

Before you can begin using CCS 3.3, you must confirm that both the CCS main executable and the CCS setup utility are configured to run as administrator and in Windows XP compatibility mode. Check the properties for both the **CCStudio v3.3** shortcut and the **Setup CCStudio v3.3** shortcut. Look to make sure **Compatibility mode** is configured for Windows XP (SP2 or SP3) and the checkbox for **Run this program as an administrator** is enabled.

Once this is complete, you should be able to run CCS normally:

## Known Limitations 

On 64-bit systems, the ability to use the CCS **Component Manager** to use standalone compiler versions will not work. This is because the Windows registry structure that these standalone compiler verisons assume is for 32-bit Windows only. A crude workaround is to manually copy the contents of the standalone compiler to the existing compiler folder in CCS 3.3. It is basically copying all the content inside the new compiler into <tt>[CCS 3.3 INSTALL DIR]\\[DEVICE FAMILY]\\cgtools</tt> (backup the cgtools folder first and then erase everything in there before copying the new content over).
