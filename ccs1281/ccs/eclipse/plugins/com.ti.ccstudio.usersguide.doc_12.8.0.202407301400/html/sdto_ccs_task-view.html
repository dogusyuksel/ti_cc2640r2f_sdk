##Introduction

CCS has a Tasks view that allows user to keep track of 'To-Do'(or Tasks) List. Task markers can be used to annotate source files with To-Do's or bug entries. The Tasks view can then be used to view them and use them as shortcuts to find the source location.

The Task view can be opened from menu **View->Other->General->Tasks**
 
##Adding Tasks 

Tasks can either be tied to a source file or not. 

### Adding task tied to source file

To add a task that is tied to a source file use one of the following methods:
1. Open the source file, right-click on the left pane of the editor at the desired line, click on Add Task...<br> Add a description and set a priority if desired. <br><br>
	- This type of task has a checkbox in the Tasks view that can be marked as Completed.
	- It adds markers to the source view so you can easily spot them in the editor.
	- It does not move with the source file when it is copied over to another project.

2. Open the source file and add comments in the source like this:<br>
 `//TODO Re-write this function`
<br>TODO is a special tag that tells CCS that this is a task. CCS parses the source files in the background and auto-generates the tasks that will show up in the Tasks view.
The list of tags that are to be recognized as tasks are defined under menu *Window Preferences->C/C++->Task tags*, and additional tags can be defined there as well. <br><br>
	- This type of task will not have a checkbox in the Tasks view, and cannot be marked as Completed.  It will only go away once the comment is deleted from the .c file.  Double-clicking on the task in the Tasks view will take you to the line containing that comment in the source file.
	- This task moves with the source file. So the source file can be shared across a team and added to different projects (with the file itself being excluded from build if it is not required to be built with the project).
	- Task information is stored in .markers file in \.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources\.projects\blinky. Note that this is not a text file.

###Adding task not tied to source file
To add a generic task that is not tied to a source file:

Right-click inside the Tasks view and click on Add Task...<br> Add a description and set a priority if desired.
	- This type of task has a checkbox in the Tasks view that can be marked as Completed.
	- This task is stored in a file named .markers in \.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources\.root. Note that this is not a text file. This file can be copied over to another workspace if you wish to see the tasks within that workspace.
