The **Stack Usage View** in Code Composer Studio (available in CCS 6.2 and higher) provides a static view of stack usage for your application. The information is generated on project build and displayed as a function call tree with stack usages for each function in a horizontal bar graph. 

To open the view go to the CCS menu **View** and select **Stack Usage**.

The view shows **Exclusive Size** and **Inclusive Size** by function. The **Exclusive Size** is the amount of stack required by that function, ignoring any functions it may call.  The **Inclusive Size** is the amount of stack required by that function, plus the amount of stack required by all the functions called by that function, applied recursively. So, if f1 calls f2, which calls f3, which calls f4, and so on, the amount of stack required by each of those functions is added in for the Inclusive Size.  

The size values shown in the view are in bytes. 

The color shading indicates whether you are close to the limit of available stack space (shown as yellow) or not (shown as green). To avoid hitting the limit, you could free up some stack usage or increase the system stack size.
