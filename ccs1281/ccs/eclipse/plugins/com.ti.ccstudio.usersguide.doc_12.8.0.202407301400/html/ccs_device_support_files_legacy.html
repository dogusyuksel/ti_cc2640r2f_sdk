#Introduction
This page contains direct download links for device support files to be used in Code Composer Studio target configuration files.  

[[r IMPORTANT:
   The packages available on this page are applicable to CCSv8 and older. For newer releases, please check the [Device support files](ccs_device_support_files.html) page.
]]

They add generic part numbers (i.e., without variant, packaging and speed info) and evaluation boards to the list of devices in the target configuration editor, including also linker command files and project wizard options (accessible via menu <strong>CCS</strong> &rarr; <strong>New</strong> &rarr; <strong>CCS Project</strong>.

Code Composer Studio adds all the information present on this page for all the supported devices. Sometimes there may be some discrepancies between the files here and the ones provided with CCS, as this page may contain yet unreleased versions.

[[b Notes:
   - These files are provided '''as-is''' without support.
   - These files were tested with all CCSv8 releases. 
   - Despite all efforts to provide a complete set of registers, the device support may contain partial or complete peripheral registers for some devices.
   - <strong>COMPATIBILITY NOTE:</strong> Several generic device part numbers (AM335x, TI816x, etc.) are removed from the package. If your target configuration file (.ccxml) uses one of them, you will have to re-generate it to match an actual device part number (AM3356, DM8168, etc.).
   - Each device support ZIP file contains a file named &lt;revision_history.txt&gt; under the directory <strong>doc</strong>. It is important to read the information contained there.
   - This information is being constantly updated. Check back regularly!
]]

#Usage:

[[r IMPORTANT:
   The packages available on this page are also available via the CCS update online server, which has the benefit to automatically inform you when an update is available.
   
   These packages do not install the necessary compilers and other definitions for the device family. To properly add them, check section 3.1 of the [Updating CCS](./ccsv7_updates.html) page.

<font color="#F000F0"><strong>1.</strong></font> Close Code Composer Studio

<font color="#F000F0"><strong>2.</strong></font> Download the file corresponding to your device family

<font color="#F000F0"><strong>3.</strong></font> Extract the file to the directory <tt>&lt;CCS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/ccsv8/ccs_base</tt>.

   - By default it can be either <tt>C:\\ti</tt> for Windows or <tt>/opt/ti</tt> for Linux
   - The packages <strong>Digital Power devices (UCD)</strong> and <strong>mmWave Radar devices</strong> must be extracted to the directory <tt>&lt;CCS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/ccsv8</tt>

<font color="#F000F0"><strong>4.</strong></font> Say yes to overwrite existing files

<font color="#F000F0"><strong>5.</strong></font> Run Code Composer Studio with the -clean option (ccstudio.exe -clean)

   - Running with the clean option ensures that the cache of the xml database gets updated
