#Overview
This page shows performance measurements and comparison tables among the different classes of XDS Debug Probes (JTAG Emulators). It is not intended as an official benchmark and should be used for reference only, as the procedure depicted here is limited when compared to real-world debugging scenarios.

- It uses Code Composer Studio's Debug Server Scripting (DSS) feature that allows running JTAG debug sessions from the command line
- The use of DSS allows the benchmark process to be automated and reduce the influence of the graphical IDE in the measurements
- It is focused on two major types of tests: throughput and interactive
- The throughput tests perform data transfers to/from the target and measure the time elapsed to complete them. 
- The interactive tests perform a sequence of typical debug operations such as single step or display a series of printf statements (console output) that are relevant to the overall user experience. 
- The benchmarks chosen are very useful to compare the different JTAG debug probes.

	<b>Notes:</b>

	All JTAG TCLK speeds are 10.368MHz except where noted

	All Debug probes are operating in JTAG mode except where noted
+]]

##Important note about JTAG TCLK frequencies:
[[+y Expand for details about TCLK
Some of the emulators allow setting limits to the JTAG TCLK frequency from the CCS Target Configuration editor, which can potentially increase the debugging and loading speed. 

However, at the moment of connection the emulator performs some tests on the JTAG serial connection and automatically chooses a reliable TCLK speed, which can be lower than the setting configured in CCS. The most obvious practical effect is that some of the tests below show the same throughput even when setting different TCLK speeds.

For details on the JTAG emulator and board design constraints that affect performance, check the [XDS Target Connection Guide](../xdsdebugprobes/emu_xds_target_connection_guide.html).

The XDS560v2 emulators actually report back the reliability of the JTAG TCLK measurements when the <I>Test Connection</I> button is used from the CCS Target Connection editor, and it is shown as:
<pre>
The IR/DR scan-path tests used 50.00MHz as the final frequency.

-----[Measure the source and frequency of the final JTAG TCLKR input]--------

The frequency of the JTAG TCLKR input is measured as 49.99MHz.
</pre>
This helps to know the actual speed being used by the JTAG debugger.

The <b>Executable Load throughput test</b> performs a standard program load of an ELF executable to the target device's program memory. The program contains a large data array whose size varies depending on the device's amount of available memory.

#Test results sorted by type of test
##Throughput tests
The tests on this section focus on data throughput from the host PC to the target processor to compare the performance of different emulators and JTAG settings.

	<b>Note:</b> For MCUs the executable is loaded/executed in Flash and the binaries to SRAM, while for EPs the external RAM is used in all tests. 

###Executable Load
The Executable Load throughput test performs a standard program load of an ELF executable to the target device's program memory. The program contains a large data array whose size varies depending on the device's amount of available memory.
