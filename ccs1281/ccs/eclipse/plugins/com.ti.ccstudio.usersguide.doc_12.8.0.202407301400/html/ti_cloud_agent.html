## Overview

The TI Cloud Agent is a small application that facilitates flashing and debugging hardware devices from the Texas Instruments Cloud Tools. A browser extension, called the TI Cloud Agent Bridge, must be installed separately to enable the browser to communicate with the main application.
Device-specific support files are downloaded as needed to minimize the installed footprint size. The initial installation requires elevated permissions in order to install hardware drivers.


## Requirements

### OS
* Windows: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10
* Linux: details on the Linux distributions supported is available [here](https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccs_linux_host_support.html)
* Mac: 10.9 (Mavericks) and up (64 bit only)

### Hardware
* Free Disk Space: 20-100MB. Since device-specific flash components are downloaded as needed, the actual size varies quite a bit. 20MB is the the bare minimum, and 100MB would be needed to support multiple devices.
* Memory: 100MB
* Processor: 1+ GHz, requires SSE2 instruction set which some processors released prior to 2003 may not have.

### Browser Requirements
* Firefox: Version 52 and up.
* Chrome: Version 60 and up.

### Permissions
The user account which will use TI Cloud Agent must have the ability to install the TI Cloud Agent with the required elevated (administrator) privileges. 

### Supported Devices

TI Cloud agent supports all MCU families when used with UniFlash. The Cloud IDE supports most launchpads (excluding Hercules).

The Cloud IDE does not support debugging of the old [MSP-EXP430G2](http://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430G2) LaunchPads when used on Linux or MacOS. However, the new [MSP-EXP430G2ET](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430G2ET) LaunchPads are supported.

Loading of images to flash is supported on all operating systems.


## Troubleshooting

### TI Cloud Agent Installation

Please ensure you have followed all the instructions on the **TI Cloud Agent Installation** dialog. You should only have to perform each step once.

![](./images/TICloudAgentInstallation.png)

If you are still having issues please check the following:

* Verify your browser version is supported and up to date

* **Chrome**:
Click on Chrome menu icon (the three dots next to your profile picture) in the top right and select **Settings** then **Extensions**. Find **TICloudAgent Bridge** and ensure **Enabled** is checked.
Do not use incognito mode, or select **Allow in incognito** in the same location as above.

* **Firefox**:
Click on the menu icon in the top right and select **Add-ons** and then the **Extensions** tab. Find **TICloudAgent Bridge** and click on **Enable** if present.
Do not use private browsing.
Open **about:config** in a new tab. Select **I'll be careful**. Type **browser.privatebrowsing.autostart** in the search box, and disable the option if enabled.

* Make sure Windows short filename generation is enabled

    On Windows systems, short filename generation must be enabled during the installation. Otherwise an error like the below will occur:

    ![](./images/ticloudagent_shortfilename.jpg) 

    You can check by running the following command from from a command window:

    ```dos
    fsutil 8dot3name query
    ```

    Here are a couple of Microsoft articles on the subject for reference:  [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/121007/how-to-disable-8-3-file-name-creation-on-ntfs-partitions) and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/ff621566(v=ws.11)">here</a>.

    If disabled: re-enable it (at least temporarily), delete the <tt>C:\Users\\[userId]\TICloudAgent</tt> and the <tt>C:\Users\[userId]\AppData\Local\Texas Instruments</tt> folders, and retry the installation.


### Overriding TI Cloud Agent Proxy Settings

Cloud agent attempts to automatically detect and configure the local proxy settings. If automatic detection fails, it may be necessary to manually override the proxy settings. This can be done by opening the <tt>[Home]\TICloudAgent\util\proxy.js</tt> file and setting **exports.proxy** to your local proxy. For example: 

```js
exports.proxy = "http://user:password@example_host.com:80";
```

### Linux Library Dependencies

When the TI Cloud Agent installer starts, it will check for the presence of the required system libraries. Please ensure these libraries are present before proceeding.

[[y NOTE
Only 64-bit Linux distributions are supported by TI Cloud Agent.
]]

A common issue is a missing dependency on **libudev.so.0**. This library may not be available on some Linux distributions. A workaround for Cloud Agent is to symlink **libudev.so.0** to **libudev.so.1**.

The process of installing dependencies for the desktop Code Composer Studio installs is also relevant. For more information refer to [here](./ccs_linux_host_support.html).


### TI Cloud Agent Startup 

The below error can occur if you the user account trying to use TI Cloud Agent wasn't the account used to install it on the PC.

<tt>
Could not launch TI Cloud Agent: Failed to start TICloudAgent: Specified native messaging host not found.. Please perform the actions listed below and try your operation again.
</tt>

<pre>

</pre>

A common scenario when this occurs is that the TI Cloud Agent was installed on a PC using a separate administrator account since the standard user accounts on the PC do not have the ability to run the installer with the required elevated (administrator) privileges. However, TI Cloud Agent is a per user install. Hence, the user account will not see the install from the local administrator account. One workaround (on Windows) is to edit the Windows registry and add an entry for the user to see the administrator install. That would require duplicating <tt>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Google\Chrome\NativeMessagingHosts\com.ti.cloudagent</tt> from the local administrator account.


## Support

Please submit TI Cloud Agent logs when reporting issues on the [E2E Forums](https://e2e.ti.com/).

### Logging

#### Linux and MacOS

Edit the <tt>~/TICloudAgent/ticloudagent.sh</tt> script, and uncomment lines 4-6.

Restart your browser and reproduce the problem. The log will be located at <tt>/tmp/my_ticld.log</tt>.

[[y NOTE
For issues with TI Cloud Agent when using CCS, use the following *.sh file instead: <tt>[CCS INSTALL DIR]/ccs/ccs_base/cloudagent/ticloudagent.sh</tt>. Then restart CCS.
]]

#### Windows 

Edit the <tt>C:\Users\\[your ID]\TICloudAgent\ticloudagent.bat</tt> script, and uncomment lines 4-6.

Restart your browser and reproduce the problem. The log will be located at <tt>C:\temp\my_ticld.log</tt>.

[[y NOTE
For issues with TI Cloud Agent when using CCS, modify the following *.bat file instead: <tt>[CCS INSTALL DIR]\ccs\ccs_base\cloudagent\ticloudagent.bat</tt>. Then restart CCS.
