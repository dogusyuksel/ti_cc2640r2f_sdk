#Resource Explorer#

The Resource Explorer interface documented in this page is for CCS 6.2-> CCS 9.2.

For information on the Resource Explorer interface in CCS 9.3 and greater, please refer to [this page](ccs_resource_explorer_new.html). <br>
For information on Resource Explorer Classic (default interface included in CCS 6.1.3 and earlier), please refer to [this page](ccs_resource_explorer_classic.html).
<br>
CCS 9.0 and greater do not include Resource Explorer Classic.<br><br>

Resource Explorer helps you find all the latest examples, libraries, demo applications, datasheets, and more for your chosen platform.

Filtering by device, or by TI LaunchPadâ„¢ Kit, the interface enables you to filter the content to only what is relevant to your chosen platform.  Resource Explorer will show you not only the resources that you have installed on your local computer but also those that are located online and available for download.  When you select an example from a software package that you have not yet installed Resource Explorer will allow you to install that package, and any necessary dependencies, and then allow you to import the example into your workspace.

##Online / Offline Mode##
By default Resource Explorer is operating in Online viewing mode, meaning that it is connected to the cloud and showing both resources that are installed locally as well as those that are installed in the cloud.

If you only want to show resources that are installed locally you can switch to Offline mode by clicking on the cloud button on the toolbar.

Resource Explorer will automatically switch to Offline mode if it is not able to establish a connection to the cloud.

##Tips##

###How to tell if a packages is downloaded locally?###
If a software package shows a green arrow beside the folder icon this indicates that the package is installed locally.

###Changing software versions###
By default Resource Explorer will show the latest version of the software that is available.  If you wish to use an older version of a software package click on the home button on the toolbar.  Select the software package that you are interested in from the middle pane of Resource Explorer and change the selection from "Latest" to the version you want.

###Hiding software packages###
If you want to reduce the number of software packages that are shown you can go to the Resource Explorer home screen by clicking on the home button.  Then for the packages that you do not wish to display uncheck the "Show" box at the top of tile each package you wish to hide.
