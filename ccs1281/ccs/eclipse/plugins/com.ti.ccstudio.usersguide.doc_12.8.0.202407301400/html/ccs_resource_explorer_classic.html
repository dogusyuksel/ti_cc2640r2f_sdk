# Introduction 

This page describes the Resource Explorer (offline) included in CCS 6.1.3 and earlier. It can be accessed from the **Getting Started** page by clicking the **Browse Examples** icon or from the CCS menu **View &rarr; Resource Explorer (Examples)**.

<br>
CCS versions 6.2 &rarr; 8.3 come with a newer (different interface) Resource Explorer and the menu **View &rarr; Resource Explorer** opens the new interface. More information on this Resource Explorer is available [here](ccs_resource_explorer.html). In these CCS versions, the older interface described in this page was named as **Resource Explorer Classic** and is accessible using the menu **View &rarr; Resource Explorer Classic**. 

CCS 9.0 and greater do not include Resource Explorer Classic. 

Note that all the information in this page is only applicable to the older Resource Explorer interface.

# Detecting and Importing Example Projects 

To view the CCS example projects that have been detected on your computer, click on the **Browse Examples** link in the **Getting Started** page.

Many software packages are automatically detected and will be visible in the left pane. Some examples of packages automatically detected:

- MSPWare selected during CCS installation or installed from CCS App Center
- ControlSuite
- TI-RTOS packages installed from CCS App Center

Using Resource Explorer you can browse the contents of these packages and navigate down to CCS example projects. You can also import, build and debug projects directly from this view with a single-click for each action.

When you import a project using Resource Explorer, it will always be copied to the workspace. This may be different than manually importing a project using CCS project import wizard where it typically presents you with a choice of whether to copy to workspace or not.

Resource packages within the Resource Explorer will be visible across all workspaces and across multiple installations of CCSv6 (if you have multiple versions installed in different folders). So if additional packages are manually added, they will only need to be done once to be visible to all CCSv6 installations.

# Discovering Packages and Examples

Besides the software packages installed from CCS App Center, you may have also installed other software on your machine using standalone installers. In this case, the Resource Explorer can be configured to discover other TI software packages, and generate a resource package for them. For example, if you have Starterware for OMAPL138 installed, you can set up Resource Explorer to discover the CCS examples included in Starterware. 

To do this:

- Click on **Configure Resource Explorer to discover examples, documentation and generate a resource package**
 ![](./images/rex_classic_configure.png)
- Click on **Add** and add the path to your Starterware installation
- Click **OK**

The CCS projects within Starterware can now be navigated to and imported from Resource Explorer. 
 
# Discovering TI-RTOS Examples
 
If TI-RTOS is installed separately using the standalone installer to a directory other than c:\ti or the CCS install directory, it may not be automatically detected in TI Resource Explorer. If you use the **Configure Resource Explorer to discover examples, documentation and generate a resource package** link to tell CCS the location of the package, the package may appear in the left pane, but the example projects may not import correctly.

For instance, the discovered package may look like this (which is incorrect): 
<br>
![](./images/rex_classic_tirtos_configure.png)
 
<br><br> 
Or you may get an error like this when importing the project:

<pre>Error: Device is either 'null' or is currently not recognized by CCS. Go to 'Help > Check for Updates' page to check for updates and visit CCS App Center to get the latest device support. </pre>

<br>
To fix this, follow these steps:

- Remove the manually added package by clicking on the **Configure Resource Explorer to discover examples, documentation and generate a resource package** link, select the package and click **Remove**
- Go to menu **Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Code Composer Studio &rarr; RTSC &rarr; Products**
- Under Product Discovery path, click on Add and add the path to the TI-RTOS installation
- Ensure that the check box **Search for new products each time Code Composer Studio is started** is enabled, and click OK
- Restart CCS, and enable the newly detected TI-RTOS package
- After it is installed, it should appear under "Installed Products" like below  
 ![](./images/rex_classic_tirtos_install.png) 

After these steps, Resource Explorer should display the TI-RTOS package properly (as shown below) and the examples should import fine.
