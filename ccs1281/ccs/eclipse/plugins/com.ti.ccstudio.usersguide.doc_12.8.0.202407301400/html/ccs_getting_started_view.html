##Simple Mode##
Code Composer Studio includes many features and capabilities.  If you are more comfortable with a more simplified environment you may want to give Simple mode a try.  Simple mode strips down the user interface to just the most basic functionality.  Once you are comfortable with the environment you can use the Getting Started view to disable Simple mode.
