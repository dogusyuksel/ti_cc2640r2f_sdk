# Overview

This page contains information regarding Code Composer Studio v9 running on macOS. It includes installation instructions, device support and debug probe support. 

CCS is typically tested with the most current version and previous version of macOS available at the time of release. <br>
For the list of macOS versions supported in a specific release of CCS, please check the [CCS User's Guide](./users_guide_9.3.0/ccs_overview.html#macos).


# Download and Install 

Proceed with instructions for download and install shown in section 3 of the [CCS User's Guide](./users_guide/index.html).

In case super user permissions are not available AND the complete (offline) installer is being executed, make sure to remove it from quarantine status by issuing the following command:

  - <tt>xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ccs_setup_9.3.0.00012.app</tt>

Failing to do so will cause macOS to copy the executable to another folder and run it from there, thus fooling the installer into believing it is an on-demand (web) installer and causing it to re-download all components.  

[[r Catalina important notes

   - The XDS200-class of Debug Probes fail to properly be acknowledged when used with the latest updates of macOS Catalina (10.15.4 and 10.15.5). This is reported on the bug number [EXT_EP-9758](https://sir.ext.ti.com/jira/browse/EXT_EP-9758) and is caused by changes on how the CDC USB devices are enumerated. Check the bug report for additional details and a procedure to workaround the bug.

   - TI compiler releases up to 18.1.x are 32 bits and therefore incompatible with this version of the OS. You need to use a release 18.12.x and newer.

# Uninstall

Run <tt>&lt;CCS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/ccs/uninstall_ccs.app.</tt> 

If the uninstaller fails for some reason, it is safe to delete everything under the <tt>&lt;CCS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/ccs</tt> directory to complete the uninstall.
