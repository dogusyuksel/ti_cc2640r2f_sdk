The **Memory Allocation View** in Code Composer Studio provides a graphical representation of how much memory is consumed by your application. 

To open the view go to the CCS menu **View** and select **Memory Allocation**.

By default, the view shows the memory used relative to the total available memory for the project that is active in the **Project Explorer** view. You can expand each memory region to see how much memory each individual section or sub-section is using.

You can also view the memory allocation for any project for which you have access to the TI link-info file (even if the project is not open in the workspace). Use the **View Menu** in the **Memory Allocation** view to open the TI link-info file (linkInfo.xml). The linkInfo.xml file is generated by the TI linker with the --xml_link_info linker option, usually enabled by default for most TI example projects.
