#Overview 

The Resource Explorer interface documented in this page is for CCS 9.3 and greater. 

For information on the Resource Explorer interface in CCS 9.2 and earlier, please refer to [this page](ccs_resource_explorer.html). <br>
For information on Resource Explorer Classic (default interface included in CCS 6.1.3 and earlier), please refer to [this page](ccs_resource_explorer_classic.html).
<br>
CCS 9.x (and greater) does not include Resource Explorer Classic.<br><br>

Resource Explorer helps you find examples, libraries, demo applications, data sheets, and more for your chosen platform.

Resource Explorer is available [online](http://dev.ti.com/tirex/explore) and within CCS desktop. In CCS desktop, Resource Explorer can be opened from the **Resource Explorer** button in the **Getting Started** view or from the **View &rarr; Resource Explorer** menu item.

Filtering by device, or by TI LaunchPad Kit, the interface enables you to filter the content to only what is relevant to your chosen platform. 

Use the **Select Board or Device** filter field to search and select the device or TI LaunchPad Kit that you are using. For example, if you are using the **CC2640R2 LaunchPad**, you can starting typing "cc2640" in the search field to filter the list to easily find your LaunchPad:

<br>

If you have a valid TI kit (such as a [LaunchPad Development Kit](http://www.ti.com/design-resources/embedded-development/hardware-kits-boards.html) ) connected to your computer, **Resource Explorer** may be able to autodetect it. If autodetect is successful, you can select the **USE MY BOARD** option to specify your kit:

<br>

Once your device or TI LaunchPad Kit is selected, the filter will be applied and only content relevant to your selection will be displayed. You can now browse through the displayed content to learn more about your device, board, relevant tools, and available software packages.

# Software Package Details

Resource Explorer displays the available software packages (such as SDKs, C2000Ware, etc) under the **Software** node. This includes packages that are installed locally on your computer and those that are located online and available for download. 

Packages that are installed locally are shown with a green icon (see screenshot below).

Packages that are partially installed locally are shown with a grey icon. As an example, for the SimpleLink CC13x0 SDK - 3.20.00.23 shown in the screenshot, the SDK is installed locally but the SimpleLink Academy that is included in the package is not installed locally.
 
Packages that are not installed locally do not have any icon beside them.

## Install Software

In order to import an example or demo project directly from Resource Explorer, the software package that contains the example must first be installed locally.

The package context menu (click on the three dots next to the package name) allows several actions such as installing the package and changing, adding or hiding package versions.

A package can also be installed by selecting the package and clicking on **Install** in the right pane.

These actions are also available from the **Package Manager**, which can be opened from the menu in the top right corner.

As indicated in the message, installation progress can be viewed using the task view, accessible from the toolbar.

## Import Project

After a software package is installed locally, you can import example projects into your workspace directly from Resource Explorer. 

Select the project in the left pane and click on **Import** in the right pane.
