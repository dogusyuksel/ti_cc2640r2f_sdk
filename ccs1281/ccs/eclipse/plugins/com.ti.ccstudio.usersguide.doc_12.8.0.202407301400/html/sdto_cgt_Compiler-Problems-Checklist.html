# Introduction

You have encountered a problem while using a compiler released by TI.  This
article recommends steps to take before contacting TI about your problem.

# Read the Manual

### Manuals for TI Compilers

Each CPU family has a set of two manuals.  The **Compiler User's Guide**
describes the compiler and associated runtime libraries.  The **Assembly
Language Tools User's Guide** describes the assembler, linker, hex conversion
utility, and other associated utilities.  All of these manuals are available
on the [TI code generation tools page](https://www.ti.com/tool/ti-cgt#technicaldocuments).

### Manuals for GCC Compilers Released by TI

* [MSP430 GCC User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/slau646)
* The ARM GCC compiler manuals are part of the compiler installation.  If you 
  have Code Composer Studio (CCS) installed, then these manuals are in a
  directory location similar to:

```
C:\ti\ccs1011\ccs\tools\compiler\gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2017-q4-major-win32\share\doc\gcc-arm-none-eabi\pdf
```
# Application Notes and How-to Articles

Check the
[Code Composer Studio Documentation Overview](http://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccs_documentation-overview.html)
to see if one of the notes and articles addresses your problem.

# Specific to TI Compilers

The following two recommendations are relevant to TI compilers, and not GCC
compilers.

### Check the README

The compiler installation includes a file named README.html (newer releases)
or README.txt (older releases).  It contains information about the changes to
the compiler introduced in that release.

### Understanding Diagnostics

If a diagnostic is confusing, consider searching the internet with the text
of the diagnostic.

It may help to add the option `--verbose_diagnostics`.
This causes the compiler to echo the problem source line, with a marker on the
point where the problem starts.  If you build in CCS, look for the verbose
diagnostic in the **Console** view, and not the **Problems** view.

# Search the Forum

Use the search box featured on the [E2E forum home page](https://e2e.ti.com/)

# Questions about the Language or Library

TI does not document the C or C++ language, or the related libraries.  These
topics are covered in many books, web sites, videos, etc. which are widely
available.

Many common questions are answered on these web sites:

* [Questions about C](http://c-faq.com)
* [Questions about C++](https://isocpp.org/faq)

# Contacting TI

Post about your problem on the [E2E forum](https://e2e.ti.com).  For details
on preparing a test case, please see the article
[How to Submit a Compiler Test Case](https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/sdto_cgt_How-to-Submit-a-Compiler-Test-Case.html).
