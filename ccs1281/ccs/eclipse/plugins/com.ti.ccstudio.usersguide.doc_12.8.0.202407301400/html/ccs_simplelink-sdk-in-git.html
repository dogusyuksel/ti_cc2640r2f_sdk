#Overview

When working in a team environment, there may be cases where the desired version of Simplelink SDK is in a Git repository that each user checks out as needed. 

This document describes how to set up CCS to use a SimpleLink SDK that is in a local Git repository.

#Location and Discovery

In this environment, the assumption is that the Simplelink SDK is available in the user's local Git repository. 

In order for CCS to use a specific version of SDK during project build, it needs to first discover that version as an installed product.

CCS determines the list of installed products by searching the **Product discovery path**. To see which versions of products are installed go to menu **Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Code Composer Studio &rarr; Products**. The paths searched by default are added to the **Product discovery path** (highlighted in yellow) and the products installed to those paths are listed under **Installed products**.

In a typical use-case, SDKs are installed from [Resource Explorer](ccs_resource_explorer.html) (either desktop or online) into the default location (<tt>c:\ti</tt>). In this case they will be automatically discovered by CCS. 

However, if the SDK is in a directory that CCS does not automatically search, as is likely the case for a local Git repository, the directory needs to be added to the **Product discovery path**.

To add the location of the SDK to the list of discovery paths:

- Go to menu **Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Code Composer Studio &rarr; Products**.
- Click the **Add** button next to **Product discovery path** and browse to the Git directory where the SDK is located. 

For example, if the SDK is in Git directory <tt>C:\git\sdk\simplelink_cc13x2_sdk_1_60_00_29</tt>, you can browse all the way down to that sub-directory if you need just that version to be discovered, or you can browse to <tt>C:\git\sdk</tt> if there are multiple versions within that directory. In this example there are two versions of SDK in the <tt>C:\git\sdk</tt> directory.

<br>
Once the new path has been added, CCS will rescan the discovery paths and refresh the **Product discovery path** dialog. If there are multiple versions of SDK located in that directory, they will all be discovered and will appear in the list of **Installed products**. In this example both versions of SDK are discovered.

## Same version in different locations

If you previously had a version of SDK installed to one of the default paths, say <tt>C:\ti</tt>, then the same version will not be discovered again from the Git directory.

For example, if SDK version 1.60.0.29 is already discovered from <tt>C:\ti</tt>, then after adding the path to <tt>C:\git\sdk</tt> (which contains both 1.60.0.29 and 2.10.0.48) only 2.10.0.48 is picked up from <tt>C:\git\sdk</tt>.

In this case, you would need to remove the previously discovered version. To do this, uncheck the discovery path for that product (<tt>C:\ti</tt>). CCS will rescan the discovery paths and refresh the **Installed products** list to pick up the SDK from the Git directory.

#Selection

Any product that is installed into CCS can be selected as the version to use when building a project. 

To change the version of SDK used for the build:

- Right-click on the project in **Project Explorer** view and select **Properties**.
- Click on **General** in left pane.
- Go to **Products** tab.
- Select the desired version of SDK from the list of versions provided. <br> The version selected here will be used during project build.

Note that if the project is an application project that is dependent on a separate kernel project, the SDK version will need to be modified in the kernel project as shown below.

<br>
Now when you Rebuild the project it will use the selected version of SDK from the Git directory.

This [article](../training/quicktips/ccsv7_update_simplelink_sdk.html) describes in bit more detail the process of changing the version of SimpleLink SDK for both single project and separate kernel project scenarios.
