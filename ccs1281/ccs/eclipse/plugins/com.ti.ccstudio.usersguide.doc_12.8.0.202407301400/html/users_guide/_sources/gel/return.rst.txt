GEL return Statement
--------------------

GEL supports the standard C return statement within a function. The general form is:

``return [expression];``

A function does not need to return a value; a return statement with no expression causes control, but no useful value, to be returned to the caller. The same thing happens when the end of a function is reached without encountering a return statement. The calling function can ignore a value returned by a function.

Unlike C, GEL function definitions do not specify their return type. The return type is determined during run-time.
