GEL_SyncStepOver
----------------

Performs a StepOver operation on every target that is in the same group
as the current target.

**Format**

**GEL_SyncStepOver([**\ iterations\ **]);**

**Parameters**

iterations(optional) specifies the number of times the command is to be
repeated. If iterations is not specified, a single StepOver is
performed.

**Description**

Performs a StepOver operation on every target that is in the same group
as the current target. The operation performed is the same as the
StepOver option selected from the PDM debug menu.

As with the other synchronous operations, the operation is performed on
all targets simultaneously.
