Register access
---------------
Accessing registers from GEL can be done either via a direct definition using preprocessing statements such as ``#define`` (details at the online CCS Help) or using any register name shown in the Registers view of CCS.

Both methods have global scope - i.e., can be used by any function of the GEL file.

Registers defined via macro:

.. image:: ./images/gel_registers_macro.png

Registers globally accessible:

.. image:: ./images/gel_registers_global.png

.. note:: the global registers are defined by the CCS Module XML files. Details about this proces are shown in the section :ref:`debug-overview`.
