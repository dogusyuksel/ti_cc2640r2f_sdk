Global Variables for GEL Functions
----------------------------------

Itâ€™s possible to declare global variables outside of a function in a GEL file. A global can be declared the same way as a GEL local variable in a function. 
A string global must be declared with an initial value.
A numeric global declared without an initial value will be initialized to 0.

A GEL file with a global will be declared when it is loaded and "undeclared" when it is unloaded. Globals must have unique names; if you declare a global with the same name as one already declared, an error will result. Also, if a target global variable or label uses the same name as a GEL global, the target value will take precedence.
