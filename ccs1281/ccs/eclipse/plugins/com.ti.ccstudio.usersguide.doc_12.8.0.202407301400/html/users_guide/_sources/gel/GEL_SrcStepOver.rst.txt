GEL_SrcStepOver()
-----------------

Step over source code.

**Syntax**

GEL_SrcStepOver()

**Parameters**

count(optional) specifies the number of times the command is to be
repeated. If no count is specified, executes a single assembly
instruction.

**Description**

Execute the next available instruction in C or assembly source without
following function calls then halt. If an action brings you into an area
with no source code, the debugger continues stepping until source code
(somewhere) is reached. Repeats count times.

The source file can be viewed entirely in C or displayed at the same
time as the assembly instructions. In C source mode, this command steps
over an entire C instruction. Otherwise, it steps over a single assembly
instruction. However, to protect the processor's pipeline, several
instructions following a delayed branch or call may be considered part
of the same statement. In this case, the command may execute more than
one instruction at a time.
