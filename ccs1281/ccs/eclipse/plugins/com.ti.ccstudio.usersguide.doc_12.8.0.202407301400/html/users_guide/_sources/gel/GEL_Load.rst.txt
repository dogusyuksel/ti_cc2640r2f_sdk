GEL_Load()
----------

Loads a program

**Syntax**

**GEL_Load( "**\ fileName" [**,"**\ cpuName\ **"**]
[**,"**\ boardName\ **"**] **);**

**Parameters**

filenamenames is the file name of program file to be loaded. The
fileName must be enclosed in quotation marks.

cpuName(optional) names the CPU on which to load the file (useful in a
multiprocessor environment). The cpuName must be enclosed in quotation
marks.

boardName(optional) is the text string specified as the Board Name in
the target configuration. The boardName must be enclosed in quotation
marks.

**Description**

This function downloads both program code and data onto the target at
the addresses specified in the file. Symbols are loaded into a symbol
table maintained by the debugger on the host. The symbols are loaded at
the code and data addresses specified in the file.

**Supported file formats**

-  COFF
-  ELF
-  S-Record
-  Intel Hex
-  Tektronix Hex

If the file is not in the current directory, provide a full path name
within the string. A double backslash escape sequence is required to
ensure that you get a backslash into the fileName.

The cpuName must match the CPU name as configured in the multiprocessor
setup. In a single processor system, you do not need to fill this field.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: No

Completely synchronous: No

**Example**

GEL_Load("c:\\mydir\\myfile.out", "cpu_a", "Emulator");
