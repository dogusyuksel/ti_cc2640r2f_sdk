GEL Macros
----------

Now there is a way to make GEL files portable across different machines
by using macros.

In GEL files, you can use the macro "$(GEL_file_dir)" in an expression.
Before evaluating, GEL will replace that with the directory that the GEL
file is located in. This can simplify strings and / or make it easier to
share GEL files between users.

Now instead of having to type GEL_Load( "C:\\My Documents\\workspace\\My
Projects\\Bull\\bull.out" ), you can simply type GEL_Load(
"$(GEL_file_dir)\\bull.out" ).

Example:

GEL_Load( "$(GEL_file_dir)\\bull.out" )
