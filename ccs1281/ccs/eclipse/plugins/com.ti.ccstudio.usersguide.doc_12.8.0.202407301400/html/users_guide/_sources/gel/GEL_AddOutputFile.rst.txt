GEL_AddOutputFile()
-------------------

**Syntax**

To create a breakpoint at a specifed address for use with FileI/O
output:

**GEL_AddOutputFile(**\ programAddr\ **, "**\ connectFileName\ **",**
Format\ **, "**\ dataAddr\ **" [, "**\ length\ **"] [,** page\ **] [,
"**\ condition\ **"])**

To create a breakpoint at the specifed line in the specified source file
for use with FileI/O output:

**GEL_AddOutputFile("**\ srcFileName\ **",** lineNumber\ **,
"**\ connectFileName\ **",** Format\ **, "**\ dataAddr\ **" [,
"**\ length\ **"] [,** page\ **] [, "**\ condition\ **"])**

**Parameters**

SrcFileName is a string value specifying the path and filename of the
source file to place the breakpoint in. The file path need not be
provided. The file must have been compiled as part of the current set of
loaded symbols in order to be properly resolved.

lineNumber is a long integer value specifying the line in srcFileName at
which to place the breakpoint.

programAddr is a value specifying an expression that evaluates to the
location of the breakpoint. This expression must **not** be enclosed in
quotation marks. If programAddr is not specified, the current address is
used.

ConnectFileName is a string value specifying the path and filename of
the data output file to which to connect the breakpoint. A double
backslash escape sequence is required to ensure that a backslash is
inserted into the filename. For example: "c:\\ti\\myprojects\\out.dat".

format is an integer value representing the file format. The following
choices are available:

+-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
| 1                     | \*.dat                | Hex                   |
|                       |                       |                       |
| 2                     | \*.dat                | Integer               |
|                       |                       |                       |
| 3                     | \*.dat                | Long                  |
|                       |                       |                       |
| 4                     | \*.dat                | Float                 |
|                       |                       |                       |
| 5                     | \*.out                | COFF                  |

dataAddr is a string value specifying an expression that evaluates to an
address; this is the address from which data will be read from to write
to the output file.

length(optional) is a string value that specifies an expression
evaluating to the number of words to be read from the target, starting
at dataAddr, each time the breakpoint is hit. The default value is 1.

pagean integer value that specifies the page on which dateAddr is
located, where the File I/O transfers will read/write to. On targets
that do not support paged memory, specify 0. Otherwise, the following
choices are available: 0 (Program memory), 1 (Data memory) or 2 (I/O
space)

condition(optional) is a string value specifying the condition under
which the breakpoint should be executed (that is, the FileI/O transfer
should take place). The default value is "".

**Description**

This function has two uses. The first format listed creates a breakpoint
at the specified address, opens the specified output file, connects it
to the breakpoint, and places the resulting output FileI/O item in the
Playing state.

The second format listed creates a breakpoint at the specified line in
the specified source file, opens the specified output file, connects it
to the breakpoint, and places the resulting output FileI/O item in the
Playing state.
