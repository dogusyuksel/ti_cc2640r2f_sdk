OnResetDetected()
-----------------

GEL callback that occurs when a reset is detected in the system.

**Syntax**

**OnResetDetected();**

**Parameters**

None

**Description**

This callback is called whenever a reset is detected in the system other
than the default reset (typically called Reset CPU). More specifically,
it is called once a reset is detected and the target later halts. The
reset occurs when the target executing code performs a reset, or when
invoked from the advanced reset menu or GEL function.

The difference between OnReset() and OnResetDetected() is that OnReset()
is only triggered when Reset CPU has been selected, while
OnResetDetected() is triggered when any type of reset occurs. Thus,
OnResetDetected() is a super function of OnReset().
