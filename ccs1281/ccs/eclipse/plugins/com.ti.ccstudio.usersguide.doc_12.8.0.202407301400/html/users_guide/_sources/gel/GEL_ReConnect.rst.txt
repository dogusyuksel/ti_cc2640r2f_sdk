GEL_ReConnect
-------------

GEL built-in function that can be called on a connected target to re-send the 
connection sequence to it.

**Syntax**

**GEL_ReConnect()**

**Parameters**

None

**Description**

The function effectively disconnects and connects the target and then returns. 
Unlike calling GEL_Disconnect() followed by GEL_Connect(), it will not generate
any GEL callbacks nor trigger a UI update.  This function exists only for 
specific devices that require the jtag/swd connection sequence to be re-sent in
specific scenarios, such as when communicating with a bootloader.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: Yes

Completely synchronous: Yes
