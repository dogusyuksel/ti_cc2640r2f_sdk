GEL_EvalOnTarget()
------------------

Evaluate a GEL expression on a target

**Syntax**

**GEL_EvalOnTarget(** target_path_name, expression, synchronous = true
**);**

**Parameters**

target_path_name is the path name of the target on which the expression
will be evaluated

expression is the expression to be evaluated

synchronous, if true, GEL_EvalOnTarget won't return until expression has
completed. If false, it will start the evaluation and return immediatel

**Description**

The GEL_EvalOnTarget function evaluates the expression on the target
whose path name is target_path_name. If synchronous, it returns the
result of the underlying expression. Otherwise zero is returned
