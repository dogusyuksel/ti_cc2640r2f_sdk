GEL Preprocessing Statements
----------------------------

GEL supports the standard #define preprocessing keyword. This is the only preprocessing keyword currently available.

A control line such as the following causes the preprocessor to replace subsequent instances of the identifier with the given sequence of tokens:

``#define identifier token-sequence``

Leading and trailing white spaces around the token sequence are discarded.

A control line such as the following, where there is no space between the first identifier and the open parenthesis, is a macro definition with Parameters given by the identifier list:

``#define identifier( identifier-list ) token-sequence``

When a macro has been defined using the #define keyword, you may use it anywhere in that file as well as in any other files that are loaded subsequently into the Code Composer Studio debugger.
