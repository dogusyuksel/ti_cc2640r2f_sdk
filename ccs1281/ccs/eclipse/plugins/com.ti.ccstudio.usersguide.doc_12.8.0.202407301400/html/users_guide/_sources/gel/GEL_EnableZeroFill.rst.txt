GEL_EnableZeroFill
------------------

The ELF format binary file could include segments that require the
loader to zero fill target memory ( see PT_LOAD entry type in the ELF
program header ). This function provides a way for the user to indicate
wheather they would like to enforce this behaviour. By default the CCS
program loader does not zero fill target memory because of known issues
in some linkers to include unnecessary PT_LOAD entries which leads to
performance degradation. Generally, these kinds of PT_LOAD segments are
included when using the RAM intialization model to zero fill
unintialized global variables as required by the ansi-c specification.

This function should be called to set the desired behaviour prior to
calling `GEL_Load <GEL_Load.html>`__ to start a program load
