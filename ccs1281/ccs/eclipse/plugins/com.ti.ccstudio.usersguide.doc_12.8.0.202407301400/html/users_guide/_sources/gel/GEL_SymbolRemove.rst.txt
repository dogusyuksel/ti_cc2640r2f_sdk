GEL_SymbolRemove()
------------------

Removes symbol information.

**Syntax**

**GEL_SymbolRemove( "**\ fileName\ **"** [**, "**\ cpuName\ **"** [**,
"**\ boardName\ **"**]] **);**

**Parameters**

fileNamenames the symbol file containing the symbol information. The
fileName must be enclosed in quotation marks. The symbol file can be a
standard COFF output file (\*.out) or a specific symbol file obtained
during the build process.

cpuName(optional) names the CPU from which to remove the symbolic
information (useful in a multiprocessor environment). The cpuName must
be enclosed in quotation marks.

boardName(optional) names the board from which to remove the symbolic
information. If not specified, uses the board name of the processor on
which this GEL function is executed. The boardName must be enclosed in
quotation marks.

**Description**

This function removes the loaded symbols that are defined in the
specified symbol file.

If the file is not in the current directory, provide a full path name
within the string. A double backslash escape sequence is required to
ensure that you get a backslash into the fileName entry.

The cpuName and boardName must match the Processor Name and Board Name
as configured in the multiprocessor setup. In a single processor system,
you do not need to fill these fields.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: No

Completely synchronous: No

**Example**

GEL_SymbolRemove("c:\\mydir\\myfile.out", "cpu_a", "Emulator");
