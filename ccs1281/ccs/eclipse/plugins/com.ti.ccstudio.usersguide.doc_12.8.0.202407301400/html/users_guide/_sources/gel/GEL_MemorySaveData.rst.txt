GEL_MemorySaveData()
--------------------

Saves a block of memory to file in various data formats

**Syntax**

**GEL_MemorySaveData(**\ startAddress\ **,** page\ **,** length\ **,
"**\ fileName\ **",**\ format\ **,[**\ append]\ **)**

**Parameters**

startAddress is the first address in the block.

page identifies the type of memory to fill: 0 (Program memory), 1 (Data
memory) or 2 (I/O space)

For processors that do not have more than one type of memory, use 0 for
this Parameters. For simulated targets, I/O Space Parameters is not
supported. GEL does not give warning messages for invalid parameters
such as invalid page values.

length defines the number of items to save

fileName names the file to store the target data. The fileName must be
enclosed in quotation marks.

format is an integer that represents the format in which memory words
will be written to the specified output file. All supported formats
could be listed using GEL_MemoryListSupportedTypes()

append represents whether memory to be saved should overwrite the
contents of the specified file (0) or append to the end of the file (any
nonzero value).

**Description**

This function is an extention to the existing GEL_MemorySave. It
supports addtional formats and could be used to save a block of target
memory to a specified file.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: Yes

Completely synchronous: Yes

**Examples**

GEL_MemorySaveData(0x1000, 1, 0x100, "c:\\mydir\\myfile.dat", 5, 0);

This example reads memory starting at 0x1000 and formats 0x100 values in
format that maps to index 5 ( see GEL_MemoryListSupportedTypes ) and
saves it to the specified file
