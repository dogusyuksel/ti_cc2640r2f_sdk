Adding GEL Functions to the GEL Menu Using Keywords
---------------------------------------------------

You can add GEL functions that you access frequently to the GEL menu of
the Code Composer Studio menu bar. To do this, use the menuitem keyword
to create a new drop-down list of menu items under the GEL menu. You can
then use the keywords hotmenu, dialog, or slider to add new menu items
in the most recent drop-down list. When you select the user defined menu
item (under the GEL menu), a dialog box or slider object appears.

**Note**: There is no limit to the number of GEL functions that can be
defined. However, the number of GEL functions that appear on the GEL
menu may be limited by the size of your screen and the resolution.
