Loading and Unloading GEL Files
-------------------------------

Startup GEL files defined in the target configuration file will be automatically loaded when a debug session is started.

Additional GEL files can be loaded in the Debug Session using the **GEL Files** dialog accessible via the menu **Tools â†’ GEL Files**.

This will open the **GEL Files** view. From this view, users can see all loaded GEL files for that debug session and have the option to open them in the editor, reload the GEL file, remove/unload the GEL file, and load additional GEL files. Right-click in the view and select **Load GEL** to load a GEL file:

When a new GEL file is loaded, it will appear in the **GEL Files** view. If the load was successful, the status will be listed as **Success**.
