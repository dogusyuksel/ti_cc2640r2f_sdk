GEL_AdvancedReset()
-------------------

Resets processor.

**Syntax**

**GEL_AdvancedReset(**"reset_name" [**,**\ synchronous = 1]);

**Parameters**

reset_name specifies the name of the reset

synchronous is an optional integer parameter (defaulted to 1) where 1
means wait for the reset to be issued before returning to GEL and 0
means queue up the reset and return to GEL immediately.

**Description**

This GEL function issues any possible reset other than the default reset
for the connected hardware device. Since some advanced resets don't
indicate when the reset is complete, there is no way for this function
to wait for the reset to complete, only to wait for the reset to be
issued. However, for most advanced resets, this is the same thing.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: Yes unless synchronous is set to 0

Completely Synchronous: Yes unless synchronous is set to 0
