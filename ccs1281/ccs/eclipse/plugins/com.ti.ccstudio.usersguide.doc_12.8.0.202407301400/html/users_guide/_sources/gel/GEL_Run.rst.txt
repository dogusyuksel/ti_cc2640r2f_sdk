GEL_Run()
---------

Runs code.

**Syntax**

**GEL_Run(** [**"**\ Condition\ **"**] **);**

**Parameters**

Condition: (optional) specifies the condition that must be satisfied
while the target is executing. Once the execution reaches a breakpoint
and the condition is evaluated to be false, the Code Composer Studio
debugger stops at that address. The condition must be enclosed in
quotation marks.

**Description**

This function starts executing code on the target. If a condition is
specified, the run function becomes a conditional run statement. That
is, execution continues while the statement is true. The statement is
evaluated at each breakpoint that is encountered.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: No

Completely synchronous: No

**Example**

| GEL_Run();
| GEL_Run("A != B");
