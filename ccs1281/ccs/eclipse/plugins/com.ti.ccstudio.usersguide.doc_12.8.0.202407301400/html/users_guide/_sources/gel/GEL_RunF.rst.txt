GEL_RunF()
----------

Runs free.

**Syntax**

**GEL_RunF();**

**Parameters**

None.

**Description**

This function disables breakpoints before it starts executing code on
the target. It also disconnects from the target system. This is useful
if you need to perform a hardware reset on your target system or if you
need to disconnect the JTAG or MPSD cable. The Code Composer Studio
debugger reconnects to the target system and enables breakpoints if any
access is requested on the target system (e.g., memory read), or if the
user halts the processor.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: No

Completely synchronous: No
