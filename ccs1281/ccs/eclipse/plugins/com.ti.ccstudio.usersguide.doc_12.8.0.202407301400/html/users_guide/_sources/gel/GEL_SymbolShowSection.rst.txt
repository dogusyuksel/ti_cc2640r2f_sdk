GEL_SymbolShowSection()
-----------------------

Shows a section of symbols.

**Syntax**

**GEL_SymbolShowSection( "**\ fileName\ **", "**\ sectionName\ **",**
codeStart\ **,** dataStart [**, "**\ cpuName\ **"**\ [**,
"**\ boardName\ **"**]] **);**

**Parameters**

fileNamenames the symbol file containing the symbol information. The
fileName must be enclosed in quotation marks. The symbol file can be a
standard COFF output file (\*.out) or a specific symbol file obtained
during the build process.

sectionNamenames the section to remove. The sectionName must be enclosed
in quotation marks.

code_startspecifies the starting address where the code sections are to
be loaded in memory.

data_startspecifies the starting address where the data sections are to
be loaded in memory.

cpuName(optional) names the CPU on which to load the symbolic
information (useful in a multiprocessor environment). The cpuName must
be enclosed in quotation marks.

boardName(optional) names the board on which to load the symbolic
information. If not specified, uses the board name of the processor on
which this GEL function is executed. The boardName must be enclosed in
quotation marks.

**Description**

This function shows a section of symbols. It may be useful to show
symbol information from specific sections only. If sectionName is a code
section, the section will be relocated to address codeStart. If
sectionName is a data section, the section will be relocated to address
dataStart. If a section is moved, symbols in the section will be
relocated accordingly.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: No

Completely synchronous: No

**Example**

GEL_SymbolShowSection( "C:\\mydir\\myfile.out", ".text", 0x0, 0x0,
"CPU", "C55x Simulator (Texas Instruments)" );
