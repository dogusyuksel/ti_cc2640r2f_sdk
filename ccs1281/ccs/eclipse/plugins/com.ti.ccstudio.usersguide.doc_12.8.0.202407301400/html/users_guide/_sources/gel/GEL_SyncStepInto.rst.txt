GEL_SyncStepInto
----------------

Performs a StepInto operation on every target that is in the same group
as the current target.

**Format**

**GEL_SyncStepInto(**\ [iterations**]);**

**Parameters**

iterations(optional) specifies the number of times the command is to be
repeated. If iterations is not specified, executes a single assembly
instruction.

**Description**

Performs a StepInto operation on every target that is in the same group
as the current target. The operation performed is the same as the Lock
Step option selected from the PDM debug menu. The step operation is
context sensitive. If stepping through source and source symbolic
information is available, a source step-into will be performed. If
source symbolic information is not available, an assembly step into will
be performed.

As with the other synchronous operations, the operation is performed on
all targets simultaneously.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: No

Completely synchronous: No

**Example**

GEL_SyncStepInto(10);

GEL_SyncStepInto( );
