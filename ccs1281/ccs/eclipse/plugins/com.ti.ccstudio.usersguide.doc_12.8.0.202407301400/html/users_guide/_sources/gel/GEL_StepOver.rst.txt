GEL_StepOver
------------

Executes a function or the next statement.

**Format**

GEL_StepOver();

**Parameters**

None

**Description**

The debugger executes the function and then halts after the function
returns. If a breakpoint is encountered within the function, execution
halts at the breakpoint.

The Step Over command can also be used to execute statements that are
not function calls. In this case, the debugger executes the next
statement then halts.

If you are in C source mode, this command steps over an entire C
instruction; otherwise, it steps over a single assembly instruction.
However, to protect the processor's pipeline, several instructions
following a delayed branch or call may be considered part of the same
statement. In this case, the Step Over command may execute more than one
instruction at a time.

**Synchronous**
