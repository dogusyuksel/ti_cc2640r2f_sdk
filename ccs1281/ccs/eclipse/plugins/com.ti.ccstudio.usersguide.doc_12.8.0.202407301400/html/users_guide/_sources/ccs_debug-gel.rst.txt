The General Extension Language (GEL)
************************************

This section covers the General Extension Language (GEL), an interpreted language similar to C that allows creating functions to extend Code Composer Studio IDE's usefulness. Commonly used to initialize devices or boards, it can also be extended to perform several automation tasks within a Debug Session. 

In practice, the GEL is delivered in form of a file with the extension **.gel** and uses either the `Built-In GEL Functions <gel/built-in.html>`__ or the `GEL Macros <gel/macros.html>`__ and follows the guidelines of the `GEL Grammar <gel/grammar.html>`__ - a C-based rules syntax. 

The GEL file (or GEL script) can then be loaded to the IDE, either by manually `loading and unloading GEL Files <gel/files.html>`__ or automatically via the :ref:`Target Configuration File <target-configuration-files>`. 

GEL allows direct intervention with the target device including execution control, access to memory locations, set/reset breakpoints, etc. 

It can also build upon the IDE by `adding GEL functions to the menu bar using keywords <gel/menu_bar.html>`__, which facilitates the execution by simple menu entries to the Debug Session's **Scripts** menu.
