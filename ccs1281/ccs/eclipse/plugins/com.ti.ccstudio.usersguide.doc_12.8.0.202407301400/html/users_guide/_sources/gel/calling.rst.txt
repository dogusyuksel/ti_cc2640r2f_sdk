Calling GEL Functions
---------------------

A GEL `function <function.html>`__ can be called from anywhere in the GEL file there is a valid C expression - all functions are global. 

They can also be called from any dialog box that accepts a valid C expression, as well as from the :ref:`scripting-console` by using the function ``eval('name of GEL function')``.

Passing `parameters <param.html>`__ to a GEL function is optional. Omitted arguments assume default values.
