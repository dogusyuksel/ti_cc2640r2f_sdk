GEL_MemoryFill()
----------------

Fills a block of memory.

**Syntax**

**GEL_MemoryFill(startAddress, page, length, pattern [,
patternSizeType])**

**Parameters**

startAddressis the first address in the block.

page identifies the type of memory to fill: 0 (Program memory), 1 (Data
memory) or 2 (I/0 space).

For processors that do not have more than one type of memory, use 0 for
this Parameters. For simulated targets, the I/O space Parameters is not
supported.

length defines the number of words to fill.

pattern is the value that is placed in each word in the block.

patternSizeType (optional) specifies the size of pattern that CCStudio
should interpret. If not provided, pattern size will be interpreted as
being the word size on the memory page on which the GEL_MemoryFill
operation is taking place. Acceptable values for patternSizeType are as
follows:

Target specific types: size of the type depends on the target used

0x00 - Char

0x01 - Unsigned Char

0x02 - Short

0x19 - 64 bit unsigned integer

Large and floating point types

0x1E - long long

0x1F - unsigned long long

0x20 - float

0x22 - 32 bit IEEE single precision float

0x26 - 64 bit IEEE double precision float

0x28 - long double

**Description**

This function can be used to fill a block of target memory with a
specified pattern.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: Yes

Completely synchronous: Yes

**Example**

// Fill memory 0x1000 on page 0 with 0x1000 instances of 0xa5a5 where
0xa5a5 is interpreted by CCS as a 32-bit unsigned integer.

GEL_MemoryFill(0x1000, 0, 0x100, 0xa5a5, 0x13);
