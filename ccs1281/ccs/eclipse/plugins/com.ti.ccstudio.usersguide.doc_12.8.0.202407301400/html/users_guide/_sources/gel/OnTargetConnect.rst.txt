OnTargetConnect()
-----------------

Called every time a target is connected.

**Format**

**OnTargetConnect()**

**Parameters**

None

**Description**

OnTargetConnect() is called every time a target is connected. Its
execution will finish before anything else occurs. Note: If you connect
to the target in real-time mode, you can connect unobtrusively and leave
the target in a running state. Issuing a command in OnTargetConnect()
that modifies the target state (such as GEL_Reset), will halt the target
and defeat the ability to connect unobtrusively.

**Example**
