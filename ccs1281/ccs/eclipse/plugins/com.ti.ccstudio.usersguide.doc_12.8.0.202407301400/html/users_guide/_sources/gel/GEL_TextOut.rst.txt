GEL_TextOut()
-------------

Prints text to the console view.

**Syntax**

**GEL_TextOut(** **"**\ text\ **"** [**,**
**"**\ outputLabel\ **"**\ [**,** textColor[, lineNumber[\ **,**
appendToEnd [**,** param1\ **,** param2\ **,** .. param4]]]] **);**

**Parameters**

text is the formatted text (including format specifiers) that is to be
printed. The number of format specifiers must match the number of
additional parameters (param1.. param4) that are encountered.

outputLabel(optional) names the label that GEL prepends in its output.
The outputLabel must be enclosed in quotation marks. By default, "GEL
Output" is used.

The arguments textColor, lineNumber and appendToEnd are ignored in this
version of CCS.

param1..param4(optional) additional parameters that are substituted in
text when a `format specifier <format.html>`__ is encountered. These
parameters allow you to pass values to the output window.

**Description**

This function prints a fixed string to a specified output window. This
function is ideal for printing messages.

Format specifications always begin with a percent sign (%) and are read
left to right. When the first format specification (if any) is
encountered, the value of the first argument (parm1) is converted and
printed in an output window within the IDE. The second format
specification causes the second argument to be converted and printed,
and so on. If there are more arguments than there are format
specifications, the extra arguments are ignored.

**Note:** the function will have no effect when used in the StartUp()
function because it requires that the IDE control window be open
beforehand and StartUp() isnâ€™t active when the control window is open.

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: Yes

Completely synchronous: Yes

**Example**

| GEL_TextOut("All Tests Passed\n");
| GEL_TextOut("Failed Memory Test\n", "Diagnostic Results", 2 );
| GEL_TextOut("Tests Executed: %d, Tests Passed %d ",,,,,targExe,
  targPass);
