GEL_MapOn()
-----------

Enables memory mapping.

**Syntax**

GEL_MapOn()

**Parameters**

None.

**Description**

This function enables memory mapping. The Code Composer Studio debugger
does not attempt to read from a map segment that is not readable or
attempt to write to a map segment that is not writeable. When mapping is
first turned on, the entire memory range is assumed to have no reading
or writing capabilities. You must add memory sections (using the
GEL_MapAdd() function) to allow the debugger to access valid sections.
On power up, memory mapping is turned off by default.
