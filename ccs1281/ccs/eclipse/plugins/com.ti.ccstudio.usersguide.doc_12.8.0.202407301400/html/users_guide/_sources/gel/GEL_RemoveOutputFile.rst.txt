GEL_RemoveOutputFile()
----------------------

Removes the output file from the breakpoint at the specified address.

**Syntax**

**GEL_RemoveOutputFile(**\ programAddr\ **,
"**\ connectFileName\ **");**

Removes the output file from the breakpoint in the specified file.

**Syntax**

**GEL_RemoveOutputFile("**\ srcFileName\ **",** lineNumber\ **,
"**\ connectFileName\ **");**

**Parameters**

programAddr: is an expression specifying the memory location of the
breakpoint to be removed. This expression should not be enclosed in
quotation marks.

srcFileName: is a string value specifying the filename (without path) of
the source file in which the breakpoint to be removed is located. A
double backslash escape sequence is required to ensure that a backslash
is inserted into the filename; for example:
"c:\\ti\\myprojects\\sine.dat"

lineNumber: is a long integer value specifying the line number in said
file at which the breakpoint to be removed is located.

connectFileName: is a string value specifying the full path and filename
of the file connected with the breakpoint. This connection will be
severed and the file closed. A double backslash escape sequence is
required to ensure that a backslash is inserted into the filename; for
example: "c:\\ti\\myprojects\\sine.dat"

**Description**

This function disconnects the specified file from the appropriate
breakpoint, puts the corresponding output FileI/O object into the
Stopped state, closes the output file, and removes the breakpoint
(whether or not it was originally added by a call to
`GEL_AddOutputFile <GEL_AddOutputFile.html>`__).

**Synchronous**

Synchronous from GEL: Yes

Completely synchronous: No
