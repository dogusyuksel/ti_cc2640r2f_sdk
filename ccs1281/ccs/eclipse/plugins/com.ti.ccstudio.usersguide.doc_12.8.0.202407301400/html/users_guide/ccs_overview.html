<div class="section" id="eclipse">
<h1>2.2. Eclipse<a class="headerlink" href="#eclipse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Code Composer Studio is based on the Eclipse open source software framework. Hence understanding some of the basic
concepts of Eclipse will lead to a better understanding of Code Composer Studio. Some of the more commonly referenced concepts are described
below.</p>
<div class="section" id="workbench">
<h2>2.2.1. Workbench<a class="headerlink" href="#workbench" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Workbench refers to the main user interface. The Workbench contains
all the various views and resources used for development. When the
Workbench is launched, the first dialog prompts for location of
<a class="reference external" href="#workspace">workspace</a>. After the workspace location is chosen, a
single Workbench window is displayed. A Workbench window offers one or
more <a class="reference external" href="#perspective">perspectives</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple Workbench windows can be opened using the <strong>Window → New
Window</strong> menu. While each Workbench window can differ visually
(arrangement of views, toolbars and such), all windows refer to the same
workspace and the same running instance of Code Composer Studio. If a
project is opened from one Workbench, that same project will be present
in all the Workbench windows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workspace">
<h2>2.2.2. Workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#workspace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The workspace is the main working folder for Code Composer Studio. The
workspace stores references to all projects even if the projects
themselves do not physically reside inside the workspace folder. The
default location of new projects will be within the workspace folder.
Once a project has been added to the workspace, it will be visible in
the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view.</p>
<p>Code Composer Studio will prompt for the workspace folder location when
you launch the application. It is possible to specify to use the
selected folder as the default folder to avoid being prompted in the
future</p>
<p>The workspace folder is also used to store user information such as user
interface preferences and settings.</p>
<p>Workspaces are user specific and are not typically shared between users.
You would not check your workspace into source control to share with
other team members. You would check your projects into source control
and each user would have their own workspace that references the
projects.</p>
<p>It possible to have multiple. Only one workspace is active at a time in
Code Composer Studio but you can switch workspaces using the <strong>File →
Switch Workspace…</strong> menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="perspective">
<h2>2.2.3. Perspective<a class="headerlink" href="#perspective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A perspective defines the layout of views, menus and toolbars in the
Workbench window. Each perspective provides a set of functionality aimed
at accomplishing a specific type of task. For example, the <strong>CCS Edit</strong>
perspective contains views most commonly used during code development,
such as the Project Explorer, Editor and Problems view. When a debug
session is started, Code Composer Studio will automatically switch to
the <strong>CCS Debug</strong> perspective. This perspective by default contains
views associated with debugging.</p>
<p>It is possible to manually switch between perspectives using the
perspective buttons at the top right of the Workbench or by using the
<strong>Window → Perspective</strong> menu. Any changes made to a perspective will be
preserved the next time the perspective is opened. A perspective can be
reset to the default arrangement via the <strong>Window -&gt; Perspective → Reset
Perspective</strong> menu. New perspectives can be created simply by saving the
current perspective as a new name <strong>Window → Perspective → Save
Perspective As…</strong> menu.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>CCS Simple</strong> perspective available that can be accessed
from the <strong>Getting Started view</strong>. This perspective is used for both
editing and debugging and has been designed to expose just the most
basic functionality to make it easier for users who are familiar with
more simple environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="view">
<h2>2.2.4. View<a class="headerlink" href="#view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Views are windows within the main Workbench window that provide visual
representation of information or data. The Workbench window mainly
consists of the editor and a collection of views. Examples of some views
are <strong>Debug</strong>, <strong>Problems</strong>, <strong>Memory Browser</strong>, <strong>Disassembly</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resource">
<h2>2.2.5. Resource<a class="headerlink" href="#resource" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Resources is a collective term for a project, folder or file that exists
in the Workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project">
<h2>2.2.6. Project<a class="headerlink" href="#project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Projects typically contain folders and files. Like the workspace, a
project maps to a physical folder in the file system. The default
location, when creating a new project, is in a subfolder (of the project
name) within the workspace folder. However a folder outside the
workspace can also be chosen. Once the project is created, a reference
to it will be made in the workspace and the project is now available for
use within the Workbench and visible from the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>Projects are either open or closed. When a project is closed, it is
still part of the workspace, but it cannot be modified by the Workbench.
The resources of a closed project will not appear in the Workbench, but
the resources still reside on the local file system. Closed projects
require less memory and are not scanned during routine activity. Hence
closing unnecessary projects can improve performance of Code Composer
Studio. Note that closed projects will still be visible in Project Explorer
so that they can easily be opened when needed.</p>
<p>A project becomes part of a workspace by being created in the workspace
or by being imported into the workspace.</p>
<p>The <strong>Project Explorer</strong> shows all projects that are part of the active
workspace. Note that the view is mostly a representation of the
filesystem of the project folder. Hence when creating a subfolder and
moving files to that subfolder from within the Project Explorer, the
actual file system is being altered. Similarly changes made to the file
system will be reflected in the Project Explorer. Note that not all
files that appear in the view will exist in the file system and vice
versa. Linked files will appear in the view but because they are
references and not actual copies, the references do not appear in the
actual file system. The <strong>Includes</strong> folder that appears in the Project
Explorer displays all of the include paths setup for the project and is
not a physical folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file">
<h2>2.2.7. File<a class="headerlink" href="#file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Files can either be added or linked to a project. When a file is added
to a project, the file is copied to the root location of the project
folder. There is also the option to ‘link’ a file to a project. This
will simply have the project create a reference to the file instead of
copying the file into the project folder.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="licensing">
<h1>2.3. Licensing<a class="headerlink" href="#licensing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>There is no license fee associated with Code Composer Studio. Users are
free to download and install Code Composer Studio without having to
purchase a license. The license terms for Code Composer Studio are shown
at installation and available afterwards in the /doc folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="contents">
<h1>2.4. Contents<a class="headerlink" href="#contents" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Code Composer Studio is a suite of development tools including an
editor, project management system, compiler, debugger, profiling and
visualization tools.</p>
<div class="section" id="ide">
<h2>2.4.1. IDE<a class="headerlink" href="#ide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It refers to an
environment that brings together the tools needed to develop software.
Typically this means an editor, build system and debugger. This enables
the development of software without having to continually switch between
tools.</p>
<p>The editor in Code Composer Studio includes a wide breadth of features
to make development easier. Standard features such as customizable
syntax highlighting and code completion are present, as well as more
unique features such as local history. The local history keeps track of
source code changes and enables the comparison or replacement of the
current source with those in the history.</p>
<p>The project management system allows for the building of projects with
either the TI compiler or GCC. It also integrates with standard source
control software such as Git.</p>
<p>The integrated debugger allows for the debugging of applications running
on TI embedded devices and is discussed in more detail in the debugging
chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compiler">
<h2>2.4.2. Compiler<a class="headerlink" href="#compiler" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>C/C++ Compilers are provided for each instruction set. In most cases
this is a TI proprietary compiler. For Cortex A devices GCC is provided
but in general it is recommended to use the compiler that is bundled
with the SDK for the device. For MSP430 and Cortex M based MCUs a TI
proprietary compiler and GCC are provided. GCC is the open source GNU
compiler. Additional compilers are available from the App Center.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resource-explorer">
<h2>2.4.3. Resource Explorer<a class="headerlink" href="#resource-explorer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Resource Explorer helps you find all the latest examples, libraries,
demo applications, datasheets, and more for your chosen platform.</p>
<p>Filtering by device, or by TI LaunchPad™ Kit, the interface enables you
to filter the content to only what is relevant to your chosen platform.
Resource Explorer will show you not only the resources that you have
installed on your local computer but also those that are located online
and available for download. When you select an example from a software
package that you have not yet installed Resource Explorer will allow you
to install that package, and any necessary dependencies, and then allow
you to import the example into your workspace.</p>
<p>Resource Explorer can be accessed from menu <strong>View → Resource Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>More information on Resource Explorer is available
<a class="reference external" href="../ccs_resource_explorer_new.html">here.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="app-center">
<h2>2.4.4. App Center<a class="headerlink" href="#app-center" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Similar in concept to Resource Explorer, App Center is used to obtain
additional items required for development. While Resource Explorer is
used to obtain software and documentation, App Center is primarily used
to obtain extensions or add-ons to the Code Composer Studio environment
such as compilers.</p>
<p>Resource Explorer can be accessed from menu <strong>View → CCS App Center</strong>.</p>
<p>More information on App Center is available
<a class="reference external" href="../ccs_app_center.html">here.</a></p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="debug-probes">
<h1>2.5. Debug Probes<a class="headerlink" href="#debug-probes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>TI offers a wide selection of debug probes that enable software
development on TI embedded processors. TI’s debug probes are designed to
meet different needs in terms of functionality and budget. Each probe is
compatible with Code Composer Studio.</p>
<p>Developing software typically requires downloading the resulting program
to the embedded processor it was written for. A debug probe provides a
debug communication pathway between a host computer and the embedded
processor. This allows for downloading of the program as well as
controlling the processor to enable debugging.</p>
<p>More information on the debug probes available for TI embedded
processors is available
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ti.com/design-resources/embedded-development/ccs-development-tools.html#debug">here.</a></p>
<p>Note that it is possible to add support for additional debug probes to
an existing Code Composer Studio installation by running the installer
again and pointing it at the current installation.</p>
