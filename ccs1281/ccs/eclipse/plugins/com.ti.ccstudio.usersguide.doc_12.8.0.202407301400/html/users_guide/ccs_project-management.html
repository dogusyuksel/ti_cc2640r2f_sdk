<h1>6.1. Creating and Managing Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-and-managing-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>In software development projects for embedded systems, there is quite
commonly the need to create a single project that builds related
versions of the application for different target hardware/memory
configurations, with different build options, etc. In large-scale
projects, there is also the need to organize files in a structure that
is easily navigated and maintained by multiple team members.</p>
<p>The CCS IDE is a flexible development environment that allows you to
(among other features):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Organize files in a structure that is easily navigated and maintained.</li>
<li>Customize project properties.</li>
<li>Create multiple build configurations for a single project, each with its own set of build options.</li>
<li>Specify different version of build tools for each build configuration.</li>
<li>Create a system level project that simplifies maintaining multiple projects required for a multicore device.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section discusses the project model used by CCS. It covers how to
create, organize and configure projects to help you handle different
versions of your applications.</p>
<div class="section" id="projects-overview">
<h2>6.1.1. Projects Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#projects-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>This section provides an overview of workspaces and projects, and the
types of projects supported by CCS.</p>
<p>All work in CCS is based on projects, which are typically a collection
of files and folders. Projects are stored and organized in workspaces.</p>
<div class="section" id="workspaces">
<h3>6.1.1.1. Workspaces<a class="headerlink" href="#workspaces" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>A workspace is the main working folder for CCS and contains information
to manage all the projects defined to it.</p>
<p>When CCS is launched, it will prompt for the workspace folder location.
To avoid being prompted in the future, you can enable the option to use
the selected folder as the default folder.</p>
<p>After it launches, the <strong>CCS Edit</strong>
<a class="reference external" href="ccs_overview.html#perspective">perspective</a> will be visible by
default. This perspective contains views most commonly used during code
development, such as the Project Explorer, Editor and Problems view.</p>
<p>The default location of new projects will be within the workspace
folder. Once a project has been added to the workspace, it will be
visible in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view.</p>
<p>The workspace folder also stores user information such as user interface
preferences and settings.</p>
<p>Workspaces are user specific, hence typically not checked into source
control or shared between users. Instead, projects are checked into
source control and each user would have their own workspace that
references the projects.</p>
<p>It is possible to have multiple workspaces. Only one workspace is active
at a time in Code Composer Studio but you can switch workspaces using
the menu <strong>File â Switch Workspaceâ¦</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">It is advisable to periodically <a class="reference external" href="./ccs_troubleshooting.html#general-ide">clean your workspace</a> as they could get corrupted over time. Before cleaning, if there are workspace settings youâd like to preserve, you can save the current workspace settings so they can be imported into the new workspace. Projects will have to be re-imported after cleaning the workspace.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="saving-workspaces">
<h4>6.1.1.1.1. Saving Workspaces<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-workspaces" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To save workspace settings: <strong>File â Export â General â Preferences â
To preference file</strong>.</li>
<li>To import workspace settings: <strong>File â Import â General â Preferences
â From preference file</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To see a video demo of how to save/import workspace settings, check the
<a class="reference internal" href="ccs_project-references.html#project-references"><span class="std std-ref">References</span></a> section.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Although it is the recommended method, not all settings are preserved using the above method. Another way of saving all preferences is to copy over the â.metadata.plugins\org.eclipse.core.runtime.settingsâ folder into the new workspace. This is only recommended if you are using the same version of CCS as was used with the older workspace.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deleting-workspaces">
<h4>6.1.1.1.2. Deleting Workspaces<a class="headerlink" href="#deleting-workspaces" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>To delete a workspace, simply delete the workspace folder from the file
system. Note that this will also delete all projects contained within
that workspace.</p>
<p>Deleting a workspace does not automatically remove it from the list of
recent workspaces displayed by CCS during launch. To delete workspaces
from the recent workspace list:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Edit the file org.eclipse.ui.ide.prefs file found in &lt;install dir&gt;\ccsv[x]\eclipse\configuration.settings and remove the desired workspaces. OR</li>
<li>Remove the workspaces from CCS menu <strong>Window â Preferences â General â Startup and Shutdown â Workspaces</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="projects">
<h3>6.1.1.2. Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#projects" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>A project stores all the information needed to build an individual
program or library, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Filenames and paths of source code and object libraries.</li>
<li>Build-tool options.</li>
<li>Include file dependencies.</li>
<li>Build-tool version used to build the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects typically contain files and folders. Similar to the workspace,
a project maps to a physical folder in the file system. When a new
project is created, its default location is in a subfolder (of the
project name) within the workspace folder. However you can also choose a
folder outside the workspace.</p>
<p>Once the project is created, a reference to it will be made in the
workspace and the project will be visible and available for use from the
<strong>Project Explorer</strong> view. Each project in the workspace must have a
unique name.</p>
<p>Projects are either <strong>open</strong> or <strong>closed</strong>. When you create or import a
project into the workspace it is automatically open. Multiple projects
can be open simultaneously.</p>
<p>When you close a project, it is still defined to the workspace, but it
cannot be modified by the Workbench. The resources of a closed project
will not appear in the Workbench, but the resources still reside on the
local file system. Closed projects require less memory and are not
scanned during routine activity. Hence closing unnecessary projects can
improve performance of CCS. Closed projects are still visible in the
<strong>Project Explorer</strong> view with a âclosedâ folder icon, so they can be
easily opened when needed.</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="_images/open_closed_project2.png" /></p>
<p>To open or close a project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Right-click on the project name in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view and select <strong>Open Project</strong> or <strong>Close Project</strong> respectively.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-explorer-view">
<h3>6.1.1.3. Project Explorer View<a class="headerlink" href="#project-explorer-view" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view displays all projects that are part of the
active workspace. The view is mostly a representation of the file system
of the project folder. When you create a subfolder and move files to
that subfolder from within the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view, the actual
filesystem is being altered. Similarly, changes made to the filesystem
will be reflected in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view.</p>
<p>Note that not all files that appear in the view will exist in the
filesystem and vice versa. Linked files will appear in the view but
because they are references and not actual copies, they will not appear
in the actual filesystem. The âBinariesâ and âIncludesâ folders that
appear in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view also are just references. The
âBinariesâ folder points to the executable file in your active build
configuration sub-folder (example, âDebugâ).</p>
<p>The screenshot below shows the contents of the âc6748_sinewaveâ project
in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view and how it maps to the physical project
folder in the workspace in Windows Explorer. Note how the CCS generated
project files (.ccsproject, .cproject, .project) and .settings folder
shown in Windows Explorer are hidden in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view
and how the âBinariesâ and âIncludesâ folders in the <strong>Project
Explorer</strong> view do not exist in Windows Explorer. Otherwise the rest of
the folders and files are structured the same in the <strong>Project
Explorer</strong> view and Windows explorer.</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="_images/proj_explorer.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view can be customized to show/hide
various file types to reduce clutter in the view.</p>

<div class="section" id="types-of-projects">
<h3>6.1.1.4. Types of Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Code Composer Studio supports a few different types of projects. The
project type can be specified when creating a new project. The project
type will determine the toolchain and settings that the build interface
will use and display.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>CCS Project</strong> - type of project most commonly used when working
with the TI toolchain, or with supported GCC compilers. In this type of project, the
makefile is generated automatically. Select this project type if you
are working with TI embedded processors and want to create a project
to load and debug on a TI device/kit using JTAG.</li>
<li><strong>C or C++ Project</strong> - standard Eclipse C or C++ project which
requires an external toolchain such as GCC. The project wizard
allows you to select a project type that can either generate
makefile automatically or not.
For example, if you select the Project type to be âExecutable,
Shared Library or Static Libraryâ , by default it will create the
makefile automatically. If you select the Project type to be
âMakefile projectâ it will not create makefile automatically. You
can also create a âExecutableâ project, and then modify the project
property to not generate makefile automatically. Select this
project type if you want to create a standard Eclipse C/C++ project
and have it use a toolchain such as GCC.</li>
<li><strong>Makefile Project with Existing Code</strong> - empty project that does not
create makefile automatically. This is used for importing, modifying
and building existing makefile based code. Select this type of
project if you have a code base that has its own makefile but you
wish to build the project through a GUI interface. When creating the
project you specify the location where the code and makefile reside,
as well as the toolchain used for the build.</li>
</ul>

projects, refer to the <a class="reference external" href="https://help.eclipse.org/2020-12/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.cdt.doc.user%2Fgetting_started%2Fcdt_w_newproj.htm">Eclipse online

<h3>6.1.2.2. Adding or Linking Source Files to Project<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-or-linking-source-files-to-project" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>CCS supports two methods of adding source files and/or folders to
projects. You can either <strong>add</strong> files or <strong>link</strong> files.</p>
<p>When you <strong>add</strong> a file/folder to a project, it is physically copied to
the root location of the project directory.</p>
<p>When you <strong>link</strong> a file/folder to a project, the project will create a
reference to the file/folder in the file system instead of copying it
into the project directory. Linked files appear in the CCS <strong>Project
Explorer</strong> view with a special icon as shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="_images/linked_file_icon.png" /></p>
<p>All files contained in a project (either copied or linked) will be
included in the project build unless specifically excluded. To exclude a
file from build, refer to <a class="reference external" href="#exclude-files-from-build">Exclude files from
build</a>.</p>
<p>To copy or link <strong>files</strong> to a project, either:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<h4>6.1.2.2.1. Export Resources to Archive File<a class="headerlink" href="#export-resources-to-archive-file" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>To archive a copy of all source files that are part a project (whether
copied or linked) so they can be saved to a code repository or shared
with another user, you can export the resources to an Archive file.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Right-click on the project in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view, select
<strong>Export</strong>, expand <strong>General</strong> and choose <strong>Archive File</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
<li>Enable the checkbox <strong>Resolve and export linked resources</strong> if you wish to export linked resources.</li>

<p>The resulting archive file will contain a copy of the selected resources.</p>
<p>Note that when the archive is imported into another workspace, all the
resources (including linked resources) will be extracted into the root
project folder instead of preserving the original directory structure
for the linked files. So this technique allows you to export/share
resources, however it will not recreate exactly the original build
environment upon import.</p>

<h3>6.1.2.3. Importing Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#importing-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>A more common scenario than creating a new project is to work with an
existing project. This could be either your own development project or
an example project provided by TI. In this case, you must first import
the project into CCS.</p>
<p>CCS can import projects that are created with the same version or older
versions of CCS, including legacy CCSv3 projects. However, bear in mind
that the greater the variance in CCS version used to create the project
vs.&nbsp;version used to import the project, the more error-prone the import
process could be.</p>
<p>There are a few different methods of importing projects, depending on
the type and source of project.</p>
<p><strong>Import TI Example Projects Using Resource Explorer (recommended
whenever possible):</strong></p>
<p>Resource Explorer (in CCS versions 7 and higher) helps you browse
examples for your chosen platform, download software packages and import
projects all from within a single interface. Projects imported using
Resource Explorer will be inherently copied to workspace.</p>
<p>More information on Resource Explorer is available
<a class="reference external" href="../ccs_resource_explorer_new.html">here</a>. Also refer
to this section in the <a class="reference external" href="./ccs_getting-started.html#resource-explorer">Getting Started</a> chapter .</p>
<p>To import a project from Resource Explorer:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open <strong>Resource Explorer</strong> view from menu <strong>View</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Software</strong>, expand the software package for your chosen device.</li>
<li>Navigate to the example project and select it.</li>
<li>In the right pane, click on <strong>Import to IDE</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If the software package containing the example has already been downloaded and installed, the project will import. Otherwise you will be prompted to install the software package first, after which the project can be imported.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="_images/project_import_rex4.png" src="_images/project_import_rex4.png" />
</div></blockquote>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>Import TI Example Projects Using Resource Explorer Classic (Legacy):</strong></p>
<p>If you are using CCS 5.2+ to CCSv6, you may be
interested in this import method. The Resource Explorer interface in
these older CCS versions is different than the one in CCSv7 and higher. You cannot download software packages from this interface but you can still browse and import example projects from older software packages (like TI-RTOS, ControlSuite etc) if it is already installed on your machine.</p>
<p>This Resource Explorer interface (now called Resource Explorer Classic) is still included in CCSv7 and v8 but is not recommended for use with newer software packages. Also note that Resource Explorer Classic is not available in CCSv9 and higher.</p>
<p>More information on Resource Explorer Classic is available
<a class="reference external" href="../ccs_resource_explorer_classic.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To import a project from Resource Explorer Classic:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open <strong>Resource Explorer Classic</strong> from menu <strong>View</strong>.</li>
<li>Navigate to project you wish to import and click on <strong>Import the example project into CCS</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="image11" src="_images/project_import_rex_classic.png" /></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Import a CCS Project (other than CCSv3 project):</strong></p>
<p>To import a CCS project using the CCS menu, please refer to the relevent
section in the <a class="reference external" href="./ccs_getting-started.html#importing-a-ccs-project">Getting Started</a> chapter.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Import a Standard Eclipse C/C++ Project (not recommended for CCS
projects):</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to menu <strong>File â Import â General â Existing Projects into Workspace</strong>.</li>
<li>Follow the steps presented in the import wizard.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
<strong>Import a Legacy CCSv3 Project:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Go to menu <strong>Project â Import Legacy CCSv3.3 Projects</strong>.</li>
<li>Next to <strong>Select a project file</strong>, click <strong>Browse</strong> and browse to the CCSv3.3 project file (.pjt) OR Choose <strong>Select search-directory</strong> and click on <strong>Browse</strong> to browse to directory that contains the CCSv3.3 project file.</li>
<li>Follow the steps presented in the project wizard.</li>

<h4>6.1.2.3.2. Variables in Imported Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#variables-in-imported-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>The CCS variable PROJECT_ROOT is set to the projectâs root folder (the
folder that contains the .*project files) by default. When a project is
imported (with the âCopy project into workspaceâ checkbox enabled), CCS
will create a new variable/macro named ORIGINAL_PROJECT_ROOT whose value
is set to the original projectâs root directory.</p>
<p>If the original project specifies the macro ${PROJECT_ROOT} in any paths
such as compiler include paths, it will be replaced with
${ORIGINAL_PROJECT_ROOT} in the imported project. This is done because
the project may still need to reference resources whose paths are set up
relative to the original project location.</p>
<p>Many projects are structured such that the include files reside in a
common folder and several projects can use/reference the same set of
common include files. Several TI software packages such as TivaWare,
C2000Ware are also set up this way. When projects from these packages
are imported and copied to workspace, the include folders are not
necessarily copied over. So, if the original project has compiler
include paths set up relative to the variable PROJECT_ROOT, those paths
will be converted to use ORIGINAL_PROJECT_ROOT after project import, so
the include files are still correctly referenced relative to the
original project.</p>
<p>In your custom project, if you wish to specify include paths to always
be relative to the âcurrentâ project directory rather than the
âoriginalâ project directory, use the variable ProjDirPath instead of
PROJECT_ROOT.</p>

<p>The copy process will copy over the files/resources from the original

references linked files/resources from another location before directly
editing such files. Refer to this section on <a class="reference external" href="#adding-or-linking-source-files-to-project">linked

information.</p>
<!-- When you copy a project, the new project "name" is saved in the .project file. This is the name used to identify the new project and what you would use if you import the new project via command line. However, many other settings (like name of output file, map file) and build definitions are kept the same as the original project until you explicitly change those as well. For this reason the .cproject file of the copied project may still contain references to the original project name.

If you go into the **Properties &rarr; Variables** tab of the copied project and enable **Show System Variables*, you will see that all build paths have been adjusted to the location of the copied project. However, things like **BuildArtifactFileBaseName** and **BuildArtifactFileName** are still kept as the old names.
If these variables are used in specifying the output file name, map file name etc, then they will still have the old name. It is the user's responsibility to customize these properties, and once they are done, they will reflect in the .cproject file.

<h3>6.1.2.7. Sharing Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The structure of a project is important when there is a need to share a
project with another user or to facilitate having multiple users working
on the same project at the same time. The most common use cases for
sharing projects are discussed here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sharing âsimpleâ projects or âlinked fileâ projects. Use this method
if you wish to share the project folder and all needed source files
to build the project. The source files can be either fully contained
within the project folder or linked to the project. <br /> See the page
below to learn how to share such projects. <br />
<a class="reference external" href="../ccs_sharing-projects.html">Sharing Projects</a> <br /></li>
<li>Sharing only project folder of âlinked fileâ projects. Use this
method if you wish to share the project folder only. It is assumed
that the person receiving the project already has their own copy or
access to the source files. This is a common use-case for projects
maintained in source control. In this case, the project should be
made portable so it can be easily shared among multiple users. The
key to portable projects is to avoid absolute paths. Creating
portable projects involves the use of
<a class="reference external" href="../ccs_portable-projects.html#variables">variables</a> - linked
resource path variables and build variables. <br /> See the article to learn more about these variables and how to
create portable projects. <br />

<h4>6.1.2.8.1. Working Sets<a class="headerlink" href="#working-sets" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>Working sets are used to group elements for display in views or for
operations on a set of elements.</p>
<p>You can use working sets to restrict the set of resources that are
displayed in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view. If you select a working set
in the view, only resources, children of resources, and parents of
resources contained in the working set are shown.</p>
<p>This is useful if you have a large number of projects in the view but

<div class="section" id="project-properties">
<h3>6.1.3.1. Project Properties<a class="headerlink" href="#project-properties" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>There are many settings that define the properties of a project, such as
the toolset used for the build, compiler and linker build options,
project dependencies and environment variables, to name a few. These
settings can be viewed and customized through the Project Properties.
This section describes the more commonly used settings for a project.</p>
<div class="section" id="general-properties">
<h4>6.1.3.1.1. General Properties<a class="headerlink" href="#general-properties" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>To view and customize General Properties, right-click on a project and
go to <strong>Properties</strong>, then click on <strong>General</strong> in the left pane.</p>
<p>The <strong>Project</strong> tab in the right pane (previously named <strong>Main</strong> in CCS
7.3 and lower versions) contains the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Device and connection details</li>
<li>Compiler version</li>
<li>Output Type, Output format and Device endianness</li>
<li>Linker command file</li>
<li>Runtime support library</li>
</ul>

and <a class="reference external" href="../ccs_files_in_projects.html#runtime-support-library">Runtime support library</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Output format</strong> field determines the <a class="reference external" href="../ccs_files_in_projects.html#executable-file">format of the executable
(.out)</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Compiler version</strong> field shows the version of compiler tools being
used for the build. If the project imported into CCS was originally
created with a version of compiler tools different than what is
installed in your machine or what CCS is set to use, CCS will let you
know that the version used for build is different than the original
version. This information will be displayed in the <strong>Compiler version</strong>
field as shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="image20" src="_images/general_proj_compiler_version_2.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Products</strong> tab in the right pane (previously named <strong>RTSC</strong> in CCS
7.3 and lower versions) contains the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>List of Products installed and enabled for the project</li>
</ul>
<p>For RTSC/TI-RTOS based projects, it also contains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>XDCpath Package Repositories</li>
<li>Target</li>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>Build-Profile</li>
</ul>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/general_proj_properties_rtsc_3.png"><img alt="_images/general_proj_properties_rtsc_3.png" src="_images/general_proj_properties_rtsc_3.png" style="width: 1000px;" /></a>
<p>The <strong>Target</strong> field is automatically populated based on the <strong>Device
Variant</strong> selected in the <strong>Project</strong> tab.</p>
<p>The <strong>Platform</strong> field is selectable by the user based on the target
board. It is usually auto-populated for example projects.</p>
<p>The <strong>Build-profile</strong> field shows which RTSC and SYS/BIOS libraries the
configuration build should link in. The selection applies compile
options to the C file generated when building the RTSC configuration
(.cfg). Note that this is different from the compile options selected
under Compiler Properties that apply to the user source code. For
example, if you choose the <strong>release</strong> RTSC profile, a -O2 optimization
option may be added to the build, while for the <strong>debug</strong> RTSC profile,
there would not be a -O2 optimization option. Building with <strong>release</strong>
is a good choice as the RTSC and SYS/BIOS runtime functions will be
faster and will use less code memory. Building with <strong>debug</strong> makes the
build faster, but the runtime application will be less efficient.</p>

<div class="section" id="build-properties">
<h4>6.1.3.1.2. Build Properties<a class="headerlink" href="#build-properties" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>To view and customize Build Properties, right-click on a project and go
to <strong>Properties</strong>, then click on <strong>Build</strong> in the left pane. The right
pane will display several tabs. The settings in each tab are described
below. More details on these settings and their usage come in later
sections.</p>
<p><strong>Builder:</strong> Defines the build command, makefile generation and a few
other build settings.</p>
<p>Most users will not need to adjust the default settings under
<strong>Builder</strong> and <strong>Makefile generation</strong>. These are set to use the
default build command and to generate makefiles automatically. <br />
Advanced users may wish to customize the gmake command or even use a different
make utility. <br /> See <a class="reference external" href="#changing-the-make-utility">Changing the make utility</a> if you wish to use a make
utility other than the default gmake.</p>
<p>The <strong>Stop on first build error</strong> check box controls whether the build
should stop immediately after the first build error or not. By default,
this box is unchecked. This passes the -k (âkeep-going) option to gmake
that tells it to âkeep goingâ or continue with the build as much as
possible after an error. If this box is checked, the -k option will go
away and the build will stop at the first build error.</p>
<p>Note that even if this box is checked, it will still finish building the current source
file and report all the errors found in that file. However, it will not
continue with building other source files. In addition, if the <strong>Enable
parallel build</strong> option is enabled, more than one source files may begin
building concurrently, in which case the build will stop after all of
those files are completed. Removing the -k option may be desired if
using a <a class="reference external" href="#changing-the-make-utility">custom build step</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Enable parallel build</strong> setting is enabled by default and takes
advantage of PCs with multiple cores to run parallel builds, thereby
speeding up the build time. See the section <a class="reference external" href="#parallel-builds">Parallel
builds</a> for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Validator:</strong> Sets level of adherence to different tools versions.</p>
<p>This tab is visible in CCS 7.4 and higher. This setting configures the
criticality of tools version mismatches. This is useful if you want
strict control over which version of compiler and other products are to
be used for project build.</p>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong> Pre-build and Post-build steps.</p>
<p>Pre-build steps are steps that run before the main project build takes

<h3>6.1.3.2. Advanced Project Settings<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-project-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>There are some advanced project settings that give the user control over
features such as Code Analysis, Indexer, Code Style and others.</p>
<p>To view and customize these advanced settings, right-click on a project
and go to <strong>Properties</strong>, then click on <strong>Show advanced settings</strong> at
the bottom of the left pane. The <strong>C/C++ General</strong> selection allows
access to these settings.</p>
<p>Some of the more commonly using setting, such as Code Analysis and Indexer, are described in more detail in the subsections below.
For more information on the other settings, please refer to the the <a class="reference external" href="https://help.eclipse.org/2020-12/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.cdt.doc.user%2Freference%2Fcdt_o_prop_proj.htm&amp;cp%3D10_4_7_0">Eclipse CDT documentation</a>.</p>

<h4>6.1.3.2.1. Code Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#code-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>This is the built-in static code analyzer that comes with Eclipse CDT that
reports on programming errors, syntax and semantic errors, etc. The
default settings are set at workspace level, but can be configured at
either workspace level or project level.</p>
<p>The settings can be accessed from <strong>Project Properties â C/C++ General â
Code Analysis</strong>. Make sure to click on <strong>Show advanced settings</strong> at the
bottom left corner of the dialog for this setting to become visible.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">By default, Code Analysis checks are internally disabled for CCS projects.</p>
</div>
<p>The reason they are disabled by default is that the rules defined in the Eclipse static analysis tool are
somewhat different than those defined by the TI tools. Users who are typically developing for TI embedded parts using TI compiler tools are more interested in the errors reported by the TI tools rather than the generic Eclipse CDT errors. To avoid confusion between the two sets of error checks, code analysis checks are disabled.</p>
<p>To confirm that code analysis is disabled, go to <strong>Project Properties â C/C++ General â Code Analysis â Launching</strong>, and observe that the âRun with buildâ and âRun as you typeâ boxes are unchecked.</p>
<p>If you click on <strong>Apply</strong> or <strong>Apply and Close</strong> in the <strong>Code Analysis</strong> dialog, it will turn on code analysis. This may trigger syntax and programming errors. If errors are reported only in the <strong>Problems</strong> view and CCS editor margins but not in the CCS build console, then they are likely coming from Eclipse CDT and not from TI compiler tools, hence do not impact the build.</p>
<p>Another way to confirm the source of the error is to look at the <strong>Type</strong> field in the <strong>Problems</strong> view.</p>
<p>If the <strong>Type</strong> is C/C++ Problem, it is coming from the TI build tools.</p>
<img alt="_images/code_analysis_v9_c_problem.png" src="_images/code_analysis_v9_c_problem.png" />
<p>If the <strong>Type</strong> is Semantic Error or Syntax Error it is coming from the Eclipse Code Analysis tool.</p>
<img alt="_images/code_analysis_v9_semanticerror.png" src="_images/code_analysis_v9_semanticerror.png" />
<p><br />
If code analysis checks were inadvertently turned on for a project, use
the following steps to turn it off again so the errors in the editor no longer appear:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>In the <strong>Problems</strong> view, select all messages/errors and hit <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
<li>Right-click on the project and click <strong>Refresh</strong>.</li>
<li>Close the source file from the editor view and reopen it.</li>

<div class="section" id="indexer">
<h4>6.1.3.2.2. Indexer<a class="headerlink" href="#indexer" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>This is the built-in Eclipse parser. It parses source and
header files in the project to create a database that provides the basis
for C/C++ search, navigation features and content assist (code
completion).</p>
<p>To configure or disable the indexer (at workspace level), go to menu
<strong>Window â Preferences â C/C++ â Indexer</strong>. Make sure to click on <strong>Show
advanced settings</strong> at the bottom left corner of the dialog for this
setting to become visible.</p>
<p>The default settings are set at workspace level, but can be configured
at either workspace level or project level (by enabling the checkbox
highlighted below).</p>
<img alt="_images/ccs_indexer_v9.png" src="_images/ccs_indexer_v9.png" />
<p>By default the indexer is enabled, but you can turn it off if you donât
use the CCS editor or donât need the advanced editor features. The
indexer constantly scans all open projects to support some advanced
editor features and uses a decent amount of system resources, sometimes
causing CCS to appear sluggish. This is usually more evident with large
projects or when there are many open projects in the workspace (or
both). Turning off the indexer may improve performance in such
situations.</p>
<p>In some cases, there may be <strong>Syntax</strong> errors or <strong>Symbol could not be
resolved</strong> errors reported by the indexer even when there is no issue
with the build itself. In other words the <strong>Build Console</strong> and
<strong>Problems</strong> view do not report errors, but there are errors highlighted
in the editor margin.</p>
<p>The first thing to try, especially if you are the only one experiencing
such errors within a team on a known good project, is to open a new,
clean workspace and re-import the project into it. If the errors persist
or you experience these in your own custom project, you can look at
adjusting the indexer settings or even disabling the indexer. This can
be done from <strong>Project Properties â C/C++ General â Indexer</strong>. However,
disabling the indexer completely means losing capabilities such as code
completion and navigation to declaration/definition. A better option may
be to disable the indexer markers without disabling the indexer itself.
To do this, go to <strong>Window â Preferences â General â Editors â Text
Editors â Annotations</strong> and uncheck all three checkboxes for <strong>C/C++
Indexer Markers</strong>.</p>

<h3>6.1.3.4. Pre and Post Build Steps<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-and-post-build-steps" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>As part of the CCS build, you can define pre-build and post-build steps.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-build steps</strong> are steps that run before the main project build
takes place. <br /> The pre-build step is always executed even if the state of
the main build is up to date. An attempt to execute the main build will
occur regardless of the success or failure of executing the pre-build
step.</p>
<p><strong>Post-build steps</strong> are steps that run after the main project build
takes place. <br /> The post-build step is not executed if the state of the
main build is determined to be up to date. It will be executed only if
the main-build has executed successfully.</p>
<p>One common use-case for post-build step is to convert the executable
(.out) created by the project into a hex or binary format using the
<strong>hex converter</strong> or other utilities such as <strong>tiobj2bin</strong>. The hex
converter is part of the compiler toolset (can be found in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\ccs\tools\compiler\&lt;compiler_version&gt;\bin</span></code> within CCS installation) and
tiobj2bin is included with CCS (can be found in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\ccs\utils\tiobj2bin</span></code> within CCS installation).</p>
<p>To set pre and post build steps in CCS, right-click on the project in
the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view, go to <strong>Properties â Build â Steps</strong> tab
and enter the desired commands in the <strong>Pre-build steps</strong> or
<strong>Post-build steps</strong> fields.</p>
<p>For example, to convert the executable (.out) to binary format (.bin),
the following command can be used as post-build step:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;${CCS_INSTALL_ROOT}/utils/tiobj2bin/tiobj2bin&quot; &quot;${BuildArtifactFileName}&quot;
&quot;${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.bin&quot; &quot;${CG_TOOL_ROOT}/bin/ofd2000&quot;
&quot;${CG_TOOL_ROOT}/bin/hex2000&quot; &quot;${CCS_INSTALL_ROOT}/utils/tiobj2bin/mkhex4bin&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to replace ofd2000 and hex2000 with the respective binaries for
your device, for example, ofd6x and hex6x (for c6000) or armofd and
armhex (for ARM).</p>
<p>Note that some example projects in software packages like TivaWare and
Simplelink SDKs already have a similar post-build, which you can use as
reference as well.</p>
<!--
**`Legacy Predefined Step in CCSv5:`** <br>
CCSv5 had a few predefined steps available under **Apply Predefined Step*, such as converting the executable to Intel-hex or TI-TXT format.
If you select one of them the command will be automatically populated.

![](./images/post_build_step1.png)
<br>
The **Apply Predefined Step** has been removed since CCSv6 as the hex utility integration is now different. You can go into the Project Properties, enable the Hex Utility and then have access to all the options available for the utility.

<h4>6.1.3.4.1. Running Multiple Commands<a class="headerlink" href="#running-multiple-commands" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>The fields for pre and post build steps allows for multiple commands to
be added, each on a new line.</p>
<p><img alt="image26" src="_images/pre_post_build.png" /></p>
<!--
**`Legacy behavior in CCSv5:`** <br>
In CCSv5, the Command field did not allow for multiple commands, so you could either put all the commands in a batch file/shell script and call the batch file in the Command field, or you could use the applicable command processing symbol for running multiple commands on one line (cmd1 & cmd2 for DOS). <br>

When invoking batch files, a question that often comes up is whether the batch file can access CCS variables such as  CG_TOOL_ROOT etc, so for example, variables within the batch file automatically change as the compiler version changes.
You cannot directly access CCS variables from within the batch file, but you could pass it as an argument to the batch file.

So, for example, you could do something like this in the batch file:
<pre>
@ECHO OFF
set HexUtil=%1%
set CCSOutFile=Project.out
%HexUtil% -a %CCSOutFile%
</pre><br>
and invoke the post build step as: <br>
**postbuildstep.bat "${CG_TOOL_ROOT}/bin/hex2000.exe"**

before the link step, you can add a pre-link step to the command field
in the Linker options, as shown below. The custom step is basically
prepended before the existing command and separated with an ampersand.
The below example adds a pre-link step to call a batch file.</p>

<h3>6.1.3.5. Changing the Make Utility<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-the-make-utility" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>CCS uses gmake (GNU make) to build projects. If you have a need to use a
different make utility or custom build step, you can do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>In <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view, right-click on the project and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>

<p>You can also use this if you want to simply modify the default build
command to pass additional options to gmake.</p>
<p>When using a custom build step, you may want to consider enabling the
build setting <strong>Stop on first build error</strong>. If this is not enabled it
will add a -k (âkeep-going) option to the end of the command (for gmake,
this option tells it to âkeep goingâ or continue with the build as much
as possible after an error), which may not be desired for certain custom
build commands.</p>

<h3>6.1.3.6. Project Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#project-dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Projects may be constructed such that the main project is dependent on
other projects. A common use case is when a main project links in a
library and the project for the library is set up as a referenced
project. In this set up, when you build the main project, the referenced
project will be built first and then the main project.</p>
<p>Project dependencies can be set up when creating a new CCS project or
from the Project Properties of an existing project. In order to create a
dependency, all referenced projects must be in the same workspace as the
main project.</p>
<p>To create a project dependency:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>In <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view, right-click on the project and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Build</strong> in the left pane and <strong>Dependencies</strong> tab in the right pane.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Add</strong>, choose the project to add to the list of references and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="image29" src="_images/dependency1.png" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Referenced Build-configuration</strong> column allows you to choose which
<a class="reference external" href="#build-configurations">build configuration</a> to use when building the
referenced project. Note that this setting will apply for the active
build configuration of the main project. This setting lets you control
which build configuration of the referenced project will be built prior
to building a specific build configuration of the main project.</p>
<p><img alt="image30" src="_images/dependency2.png" /></p>
<p>Creating a dependency does not mean that the library generated by the
dependent project is automatically linked into the main project. It
simply means that the dependent project will be built prior to the main
project so any changes made to the dependent project since last build
will be picked up. The library file will still need to be manually
linked to the main project. This can be done either by
<a class="reference external" href="#adding-or-linking-source-files-to-project">linking</a> the library
file to the main project or by adding the library name and path to the
main projectâs linker options.</p>

<h4>6.1.3.6.1. Inherited Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#inherited-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>

<p>&quot;${INHERITED_INCLUDE_PATH}&quot; <br />
&quot;${INHERITED_LIBRARIES}&quot; <br />

<p>It may appear that these variables are being inherited from the

<p>It is possible to set file level build options that are different than
the project level options. This is useful, for example, when specific
files require a higher or lower level of optimization than other files.</p>
<p>To set file-specific options, right-click on the file (or folder) in the
<strong>Project Explorer</strong> view, go to <strong>Properties</strong>, and set the desired
options.</p>
<p>Files with file-specific options appear with a special icon (push pin)
in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view.</p>

<a class="reference internal" href="ccs_project-references.html#project-references"><span class="std std-ref">References</span></a> section.</p>
<p>When you add file specific options, a section is added to the project
metadata file to indicate that there are file specific options and which
default options to override. When you use the <strong>Resource Configurations
â Reset to Default</strong> option on the file, it will remove that whole
section. Hence the project sees it as not having any file specific
options in the project anymore and the special icon is also removed for
that file.</p>
<p>If you instead go to the fileâs <strong>Properties â Resource</strong> and click on
<strong>Restore Defaults</strong>, it will restore the options back to default but
will not remove the special icon. This is because even though the
override options are removed, the special section for the file that was
previously added is still there and so the icon remains.</p>
<p>If you wish to know which file specific options are set for a certain
source file, there are a couple of ways to find out:</p>

<h3>6.1.3.9. Changing Compiler Versions<a class="headerlink" href="#changing-compiler-versions" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>All CCS releases come bundled with specific version(s) of compiler
tools. During project development phase you may want to build your
project with a different version of compiler tools than what is included
with CCS. One reason may be to avail of bug fixes and enhancements in
newer versions of compilers, another reason may be to stay locked down
on an older version of the compiler. CCS is very flexible in allowing
you to do this.</p>
<p>To view the version of compiler used for the project build, right-click
on the project in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view and go to <strong>Properties â
General â Project</strong> tab, and view the <strong>Compiler version</strong> field. If the
project imported into CCS was originally created with a version of
compiler tools different than what is installed in your machine or what
CCS is set to use, that information will be shown when you hover over
the <strong>Compiler version</strong> field.</p>
<p>The drop-down menu in the <strong>Compiler version</strong> field will show the
different versions available to use if there is more than one version
discovered/installed into CCS.</p>
<p>If you wish to build with a different version of compiler tools than
what is already available, you can install the specific version and have
CCS discover it. Please see the <a class="reference external" href="../ccs_compiler-installation-selection.html">Compiler Installation and
Selection</a> article for
details.</p>
<!--
The first two ways described below show how to install from within CCS and the last shows to install from outside CCS.

1. Install compiler tools using CCS menu:
    - **Help->Check for Updates** (only finds versions newer than the one currently installed).
    - **Help->Install Code Generation Compiler Tools** (finds older and newer versions - this menu is available in CCS 7.4 and higher). <br> To see a demo video, check the [References](#video-demos) section.

 In this case, CCS will automatically recognize the compiler tools and show it in the drop-down menu under **Compiler version**.

 A more detailed explanation of how compiler updates work from within CCS is in this article: [Compiler Updates](https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccs_compiler-updates.html)

2. Install the latest available compiler tools from the **CCS App Center** (menu **View->CCS App Center**).

 Note that only the very latest compiler version is available here. There isn't a way to select and install a specific older version using the App Center.

 In this case, CCS will automatically recognize the compiler tools and show it in the drop-down menu under **Compiler version**.

3. Install compiler tools using a separate stand-alone installer (download from [this page](https://www-a.ti.com/downloads/sds_support/TICodegenerationTools/index.htm)).

 In this case, CCS can be made to detect it by following the steps described here: [Compiler Installation and Selection](https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccs_compiler-installation-selection.html)

####Discovered Tools

To see which versions of compiler tools are discovered/known to CCS, go to menu **Window->Preferences->Code Composer Studio->Build->Compilers**, and check the versions listed under **Discovered tools**.

There are some paths that CCS always searches by default (typically the folder where CCS was installed). These are listed under **Tool discovery path**.
You can also add your own paths to this list by clicking the **Add** button and browsing to the compiler tool's installation directory or to it's parent directory. After the tools are discovered they will appear in the **Discovered tools** list.

Discovery paths added by the user (not the default paths) are stored in metadata information in the file <tt> &lt;CCS INSTALL DIR&gt;\ccsv6\eclipse\configuration\ccs.properties </tt>

![](./images/cgt_discovery.png)
<br>
When there is more than one version of compiler tools discovered by CCS, they will appear in the drop-down menu in the **Compiler version** field from where you can select the desired version. The version selected in this field will be the version used for building the project.

<p>Similar to changing the version of compiler tools, you can also change
the version of XDCtools and products like SDKs used to build a project.</p>
<p>To view the current version of XDCtools used for the build and other
Product details, right-click on the project and go to <strong>Properties â
General â Products</strong> tab. This tab displays the version of XDCtools used
for the build, and Products and Repositories available and enabled,
among other things.</p>
<p>The drop-down menu under <strong>XDCtools version</strong> will show the different
versions available to use if there is more than one version
discovered/installed into CCS. Similarly, the <strong>Products and
Repositories</strong> view will show all the products discovered/installed into
CCS.</p>
<p>If you wish to build with a different version of XDCtools or SDK than
what is already available, you can install the specific version and have
CCS discover it (a.k.a. Product Discovery). Please see the <a class="reference external" href="../ccs_product-installation-selection.html">Product
Installation and
Selection</a> article for
details.</p>
<!--
####Discovered Products
At any give time, to check which versions of products are discovered/known to CCS, go to menu **Window->Preferences->Code Composer Studio->Products**, and check the versions listed under **Installed products**.

There are some paths that CCS always searches by default. These are listed under **Product discovery path**.
You can also add your own paths to this list by clicking the **Add** button and browsing to the directory to search for new products. Then to have CCS discover the products in those paths click the **Rediscover** button. After the products are installed they will appear in the **Installed products** list.

![](./images/rtsc_discovered_products.png)

<div class="section" id="build-configurations">
<h3>6.1.3.11. Build Configurations<a class="headerlink" href="#build-configurations" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>During development, it is quite common to have the need to create a
single project that builds executables (.out files) with different
project options, source files or even for different memory
configurations. In CCS this is done with Project Build Configurations.</p>
<p>A Project Build Configuration defines a set of build options and
resources at the project level that can be labeled and easily accessible
with a very minimal number of steps. Therefore, by creating multiple
build configurations within a single project it is possible to organize
and quickly switch between different sets of options and resources.</p>
<p>When a new project is created in CCS, two build configurations are
created by default: <strong>Debug</strong> and <strong>Release</strong>. The Debug build
configuration usually has no optimization and full symbolic debug
enabled, to enable easy debugging. The Release build configuration will
often have optimization enabled and symbolic debug disabled, to get your
code as small or fast as possible without the need for source level
debug. These are just the options usually set for the default build
configurations, it could be different for different device families, so
it is best to check the default options set for each build configuration
and tweak it as necessary.</p>
<p>When a new project is created or an existing project is imported into
CCS, the first configuration (in alphabetical order) is set to active in
the workspace. Usually this is the <strong>Debug</strong> configuration but may be
different depending on the configuration names.</p>
<p>Note that some example projects provided by TI may have custom
configuration names other than Debug and Release. For example, projects
in C2000Ware may have RAM and Flash configurations, where one is set up
to run from RAM and the other to run from Flash. Based on the
configuration, the project may use a different linker command fle and
may or may not include certain source files.</p>
<!--
Since the Debug configuration comes up by default users usually start tweaking the Debug configuration directly when they are ready to start optimizing their code or modifying other compiler and linker options. Instead it would be advisable to switch to the Release configuration when you are ready to optimize your code. That way you can easily switch back to a known good debuggable configuration quickly whenever needed.
--><p>When a project is built, the output files generated by the build are
placed in a configuration-specific subdirectory. For example, if the
project is in the directory MyProjects, the output files for the Debug
configuration will be placed in MyProjects\Debug.
Similarly, the output files for the Release configuration will be placed
in MyProjects\Release.</p>
<p>To change the active configuration:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Right-click on the project in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view.</li>
<li>Go to <strong>Build Configurations â Set Active</strong> and select the desired configuration. <br /> OR <br /></li>
<li>Right-click on the project in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view and go to <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>General</strong> in the left pane.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Manage Configurations</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the desired configuration and click <strong>Set Active</strong>.</li>

<h2>6.2.1. Project Files and Build System Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#project-files-and-build-system-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>CCS projects use the Eclipse managed make system where the makefile is
generated automatically and takes care of managing the toolchain and
build details.</p>
<p>This section provides an overview of the project metadata files and
describes what happens under the hood during the project create and
build steps.</p>
<div class="section" id="create-project">
<h3>6.2.1.1. Create Project<a class="headerlink" href="#create-project" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>When a new CCS project is created, the following project metadata files
and folders are created in the project folder:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>.ccsproject</strong>: Stores project settings contributed by TI.</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>Ex: Stores initial device/toolchain settings entered by user at project creation.</li>

</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>.cproject</strong>: Stores project settings contributed by CDT (C/C++ Development Tooling).</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>Ex: Stores most of the build properties under the âBuildâ section (most of the compiler/linker options).</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>.project</strong>: Stores project settings contributed by Eclipse.</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>Ex: Stores information for linked resources, linked resource variables, resource filters.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>.settings (folder)</strong>: Stores project specific settings that differ from the default CCS settings.</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last">
<li>Ex: Workspace preferences</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><strong>makefile.defs (SYS/BIOS)</strong>: Additional make rules included by the generated project makefile for SYS/BIOS projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The .ccsproject file holds a snapshot of selections made at the time of
project creation, and rarely changes after that. So if you change
properties such as the device-variant or compiler tools version, the
change is not stored in the .ccsproject file, but instead stored in the
.cproject file.</p>
<p>The .ccsproject file is mainly a historical left-over from the days when
some settings were stored on a project-level (as opposed to
build-configuration-level). But the file is still currently used to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Allow the user to roll back certain settings to their original values.</li>
<li>Store some project-wide settings, such as the connection for debugging ( and maybe other settings in the future).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although it seems like this file stores some unnecessary information, it
could be helpful when trying to debug issues.</p>
<p>The .ccsproject, .cproject, .project files are XML files. It is
generally NOT recommended to manually edit these files unless you are an
expert user and have a good understanding of what you are modifying.</p>

<h3>6.2.1.2. Build/Rebuild Project<a class="headerlink" href="#build-rebuild-project" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>When a CCS project is built for the first time or rebuilt, it goes
through the following steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Auto-generate makefiles</strong>: <br /> Generates main makefile and several
*.mk include files in the active project configuration folder (such
as Debug folder, by default).<ul>
<li>makefile: Main makefile that includes the generated *.mk files</li>
<li>All of the sources participating in the build are defined in the
below *.mk files<ul>
<li>objects.mk</li>
<li>subdir.mk</li>
<li>subdir_vars.mk</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Optionally clean using âgmakeâ</strong> (when selecting <strong>Rebuild
Project</strong> or <strong>Clean Project</strong>). <br /> Deletes .obj, .pp and .out files in
the active configuration folder (such as Debug folder,
by default). It does not delete makefiles and .map files.</li>
<li><strong>Build the main makefile using âgmakeâ</strong>. <br /> The main make build in
turn invokes the pre-build (if any), main-build and post-build (if
any) steps. These steps are described in more detail below.</li>
</ol>
<p>A typical project build looks like the following:</p>
<p><img alt="image36" src="_images/project_build_flow.png" /></p>
<div class="section" id="makefiles">
<h4>6.2.1.2.1. Makefiles<a class="headerlink" href="#makefiles" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>The makefile auto-generated by CCS includes a few other files, namely
makefile.init, makefile.defs and makefile.targets.</p>
<p>makefile.defs is used for defining additional make rules for SYS/BIOS
projects. <br /> makefile.init and makefile.targets are not used by the TI
build environment. They are inserted into the makefile by one of the
Eclipse components(CDT) and can be used to extend the behavior. For
example, you can create these optional makefiles in the top-level folder
of the project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>makefile.init â included early in the build</li>
<li>makefile.targets â for adding rules for additional make targets</li>
</ul>
<p>Each file, if it exists, gets included at a specific point along the
build. You can see where they get included by taking a look at the
makefile in the active project configuration folder.</p>
<p><strong>Example of using makefile.targets:</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to add some additional clean commands (i.e. perform some clean
actions in addition to what the default clean does) you could do the
following:</p>
<p>1. Create a makefile.targets that contains rules for the
additional make targets and place the file in the top-level folder of
the project. For example, a makefile.targets file to perform additional
clean commands (in this case, delete the main.asm file) could look like
this:</p>
<pre>
myclean:
-$(RM) "main.asm"
-@echo 'Finished my custom clean'
</pre><p>2. Modify the <strong>Build â Builder</strong> tab in CCS to add âmycleanâ in
addition to the default clean.</p>
<p><img alt="image37" src="_images/custom_clean_1.png" /></p>
<p>Now when you select <strong>Clean Project</strong>, it will perform the default clean
as well as the custom myclean rule, as shown in the output below.</p>
<pre>
**** Clean-only build of configuration Debug for project test_f28377D ****

"C:\\CCStudio_v6.1.1.00022\\ccsv6\\utils\\bin\\gmake" -k clean myclean
DEL /F "test_f28377D.out" "test_f28377D.hex"
DEL /F "main.pp"
DEL /F "main.obj"
'Finished clean'
' '
DEL /F "main.asm"

'Finished my custom clean'
</pre><p><br />
<strong>Example of using makefile.init:</strong></p>
<p>This example illustrates how to hook into the generated makefile to
script a custom pre-build step. This is useful in cases where the
commands cannot be run as a pre-build step in CCS (for example, in cases
where you want the main build to fail if the pre-build fails).</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Create a makefile.init file that contains custom commands and place
the file in the top-level folder of the project. For example, a
makefile.init file could look like this:</p>
<pre>
all: custom-step
custom-step:
 @echo Custom pre-build step
 @mkdir a**b
</pre></li>
<li><p class="first">Go to <strong>Project Properties â Build â Builder</strong> tab, enable <strong>Stop on
first build error</strong>, and make sure that <strong>Enable parallel build</strong> is
not enabled.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, when you build your project, the build will stop immediately after
failing to execute the &quot;&#64;mkdir a**b&quot; command in the custom-step. And if
you change the command to â&#64;mkdir abâ, the custom-step will succeed and
the rest of the build will proceed.</p>
<p>This is just a simple example that shows how to hook into the generated
makefile to script a custom pre-build or post-build step. Similarly,
hooks can be scripted for individual source files.</p>
<p>To completely customize the makefile, you can go to <strong>Project Properties
â Build â Builder</strong> tab, and deselect âGenerate Makefiles
automaticallyâ. After the project is built once you can
edit (or completely rewrite) the generated makefiles.</p>

<h4>6.2.1.2.3. Main Build<a class="headerlink" href="#main-build" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h4>
<p>When a project is built in CCS, the main build is the step where the build commands and input files are passed to the Compiler
tools, and optionally to RTSC tools. RTSC tools are invoked only for projects that involve RTSC components (IPC, SYS/BIOS etc) and are called prior to the compiler tools. Starting with CCS 8.2, there is also support for the <a class="reference external" href="https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccs_sysconfig_projects.html">SysConfig tool</a> that can be used to configure components like TI Drivers and device-specific components (such as the networking stack, EasyLink, and WiFi) on SimpleLink devices. Each build tool takes in a set of input files and generates a set of output files.</p>
<p>The figure below shows a typical software development flow and gives an
idea of the build tools and files involved when a project is built in
CCS. All of this is handled in the background by the makefile, however
it is helpful to have an understanding of the build flow to better
understand the build output that appears in the CCS build console.</p>
<p>The build tools components are highlighted in blue and the input/output
files are highlighted in white . The RTSC Tools and SysConfig Tools are dotted to
show that they come into play only when working with RTSC and/or SysConfig.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/main_build_flow_syscfg_1.png"><img alt="_images/main_build_flow_syscfg_1.png" src="_images/main_build_flow_syscfg_1.png" style="width: 864.0px; height: 648.0px;" /></a>
<p>The most common path of software development flow, in the absence of RTSC or SysConfig, is the straight path
going from C/C++ Source Files down to the Executable file through the
Compiler, Assembler and Linker. The Assembler step usually runs in the
background and is hidden from the user. The Archiver and Library build
utility are peripheral functions that enhance the process and may or may
not be run depending on the requirements.</p>
<p>If the project is a RTSC project, the XDCtools run first and generate
output files that are then passed to the compiler and linker.</p>
<p>If the SysConfig tool is used to configure components, the SysConfig command runs prior to the compiler and generates output files (.c, .h) that are then passed to the compiler. The files generated by SysConfig will depend on which SDK components are integrated into the application. As more SDK components start to be integrated with SysConfig, more files will be generated.</p>

<h3>6.2.1.3. Console View<a class="headerlink" href="#console-view" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>At build time, the Console view displays the standard and error outputs of the build tools. When building multiple projects, the Console view will show the output for the active project selected in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view.</p>
<p>The view displays the options passed to the various build tools and any diagnostic messages reported by the build tools. The information reported in this view are often more detailed and useful than the summary reported in the <a class="reference external" href="#problems-view">Problems view</a>.</p>

<h3>6.2.1.4. Problems View<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-view" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>The Problems view provides a summary of errors and warnings encountered during project build.</p>
<p>Some messages will have a clickable link that provides more details about the diagnostic.</p>
<p>The view contains the following information in the columns:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Description of the error.</li>
<li><strong>Resource:</strong> Resource/file where the error occured.</li>
<li><strong>Path:</strong> Path to the resource that generated the error.</li>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Location/Line in the resource that generated the error.</li>
<li><strong>Type:</strong> Type of error.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the <strong>Type</strong> column says <strong>C/C++ Problem</strong>, it indicates the error is coming from the TI build tools. If it says <strong>Semantic Error</strong> or <strong>Syntax Error</strong>, the error could be coming from the Eclipse Code Analysis tool.</p>

<h1>6.3. Creating and Building Projects from Command Line<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-and-building-projects-from-command-line" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>CCS has terminal commands for creating, building, and importing
projects. This is very convenient for nightly automated builds, or
simply to perform these actions without bringing up the GUI interface.</p>
<p>Please refer to the article below for details on all the supported
commands and their usage.</p>

<h1>6.4. System Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#system-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>System Projects were introduced starting with CCS 9.x. It is a special type of project designed to simplify management of multiple projects that are associated with different individual cores of a multicore device. In the <strong>System Project</strong>, associations are made between cores on a device and projects in the workspace. Building the <strong>System Project</strong> would build all associated projects and debugging a <strong>System Project</strong> would launch a debug session for the device and load the program build from the project associated with each core.</p>
<p>For more details on how to use <strong>System Projects</strong>, Please refer to <a class="reference external" href="../application_notes/appnote-system_project_debug_launch.html">this article</a>.</p>

<h1>6.6. Understanding Tools Versioning<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-tools-versioning" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>The Code Composer Studio toolset consists of different components such
as the Compiler tools and XDCtools. It is important to understand that
each component has its own version number and updates for each component
may be released independent of a CCS release.</p>
<p>For example, CCS 10.0 includes the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>ARM TI compiler tools version 20.2.0.LTS</li>
<li>XDCtools version 3.60.02.34</li>
</ul>
<p>Updates to each of these components can be installed individually while
still working with CCS 10.0.</p>
<p>To install compiler updates refer to the <a class="reference external" href="../ccs_compiler-installation-selection.html">Compiler Installation and
Selection</a> article. <br /> To specifically understand how compiler tools are versioned and
released, please see <a class="reference external" href="../sdto_cgt_lts-and-sts-compiler-releases.html">this article</a>.</p>
<p>To install XDCtools and other Target Content updates refer to the
<a class="reference external" href="../ccs_product-installation-selection.html">Product Installation and Selection</a> article.</p>
<p>A CCS project can be modified to build with any of the available versions of <a class="reference external" href="#changing-compiler-versions">compiler
tools</a> or <a class="reference external" href="#changing-sysbios-xdctools-and-product-versions">RTSC products</a>. The same can be done with different versions of SDKs as well.</p>
<p>When reporting an issue to TI, it is important to not only include the
version of CCS, but also the version of Compiler tools, SYS/BIOS,
XDCtools, SDK, or any other relevant components and software, depending on the issue.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Compiler version will be listed under <strong>Project â Properties â General â Project (or Main)</strong> tab.</li>
<li>If it is a RTSC project, the versions of target content components will be listed under <strong>Project â Properties â General â Product (or RTSC)</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Versions of other relevant components, such as emulation, can be found under menu <strong>Help â About Code Composer Studio â Installation Details</strong>.</li>
