# Installation Instructions  #

- Check that your Linux distribution has all the dependent libraries. The easiest way to do that is to use the script provided here: Checking Linux Dependencies for CCS. To run the script you will need to install the 32-bit application support libraries.  On Ubuntu the command would be <tt>sudo apt-get install ia32-libs</tt> for other distributions it may be <tt>yum install</tt> instead of <tt>apt-get install</tt>
   - Note that for some distributions the command to install the necessary dependencies is listed below. Note that dependencies can change with CCS versions so it is worth running the script just in case CCS has changed since the instructions below were generated.
- Download the install file and untar it into a temporary folder.
   - For example: <tt>tar xvfz /tmp/ccsv5_install setup_CCS_5.x.x.0xxxx.tar.gz</tt>
- There are two different options for installing CCS:
   - Single-user installation
      - From a terminal, run the installer <tt>./ccs_setup_5.x.x.xxxxxx.bin &</tt> 
      - After the installer finishes, change to the directory <install_dir>/ccsv5/install_scripts, e.g. <tt>cd ~/ti/ccsv5/install_scripts</tt>
      - Run the install_drivers script as root: <tt>sudo ./install_drivers.sh</tt>
   - Multi-user installation (install as root/sudo)
      - From a terminal, run the installer <tt>sudo ./ccs_setup_5.x.x.xxxxxx.bin &</tt>
- A license file is required to run CCS

Below are sample installation instructions for some distributions including the steps to install the necessary libraries. 

## Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64-bit) ##

### Resolve Dependencies ###

- To allow the dependency checker built into CCSv6 to run, install these libraries:
   - <tt>sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libx11-6:i386</tt>
- Try installing the following list of dependencies before running the CCS installer
   - <tt>sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libasound2:i386 libjpeg62:i386 libatk1.0-0:i386 libcairo2:i386 libdbus-1-3:i386 libdbus-glib-1-2:i386 libfontconfig1:i386 libfreetype6:i386 libgconf-2-4:i386 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0:i386 libgtk2.0-0:i386 libice6:i386 lib32ncurses5 liborbit2:i386 libpango-1.0-0:i386 libpangocairo-1.0-0:i386 libpangoft2-1.0-0:i386 libpng12-0:i386 libsm6:i386 lib32stdc++6 libusb-0.1-4:i386 libx11-6:i386 libxext6:i386 libxi6:i386 libxrender1:i386 libxt6:i386 libxtst6:i386 lib32z1 libgnomevfs2-0:i386 libcanberra-gtk-module:i386</tt>
- libudev0 will still be flagged as missing. Still looking at how to resolve that dependency. The following is a work around:
   - <tt>sudo apt-get install libudev1:i386</tt>
   - <tt>ln -sf /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.1 /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libudev.so.0</tt>
- OPTIONAL: Adobe Reader 9 installation
   - Some pdf documents in Resource Explorer require Adobe Reader, which is no longer easily available for Ubuntu. To install Adobe:
      - Download Adobe Reader (32-bit), from Adobe site: ftp.adobe.com .. reader .. 9.5.5
      - Open a command line, change to the directory containing .deb file.
      - Install package, forcing to accept 32-bit version and any errors:
         - <tt>sudo dpkg -i --force-architecture AdbeRdr9.5.5-1_i386linux_enu.deb</tt>
         - <tt>sudo apt-get -f install</tt>
      - Add the missing 32-bit libraries: (skip this step for 32-bit)
         - <tt>sudo apt-get install libxml2:i386 lib32stdc++6</tt>   
   
## Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (64-bit) ##

<b>Note</b> Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit has instabilities with aptitude (update manager) that may prevent installing the required 32-bit libraries. Check its [Release Notes](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuDesktop#PrecisePangolin.2BAC8-ReleaseNotes.2BAC8-CommonInfrastructure-1.Upgrades) and bugs [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ia32-libs/+bug/879091) and [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/aptitude/+bug/831768)

- Download the install file and extract it with Archive Manager (running from a pre-extracted archive does not work)
- Install 32bit application libraries <tt>sudo apt-get install ia32-libs</tt>
- Install other required libraries <tt>sudo apt-get install libjpeg62:i386 libgnomevfs2-0:i386 liborbit2:i386</tt>
- Run the installer (if installing as user run the driver installation script afterward
- If the either the ia32-libs installation or the CCS installation still won't run try running <tt>sudo apt-get update</tt> or run the Ubuntu update manager to make sure all libraries are up to date. Then install ia32-libs again, then try the CCS installer.
- Ubuntu currently has a [bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/appmenu-gtk/+bug/932860) that causes messages of the form "wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64" to be printed in the console. These seem to be harmless.

A couple of users have reported seeing the error message <b>GLib-WARNING **: getpwuid_r(): failed due to unknown user id</b> when trying to run the installer. The root cause of this problem isn't known but it appears to be a bug in pam_sss and/or nss_sss libraries. They have been able to work around it by installing nscd or by running the installer as sudo.

## Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (32-bit) ##

- Install libjpeg library <tt>sudo apt-get install libjpeg62</tt>
- Download the install file and extract it with Archive Manager (running from a pre-extracted archive does not work)
- Run the installer (if installing as user run the driver installation script afterwards)

## Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (32-bit) ##

- Download the install file and extract it
- Run the installer as root <tt>sudo ./ccs_setup_5.x.x.xxxxxx.bin &</tt>
   - Can also be run as user but you will need to run a script to install the emulation drivers afterwards

# Updating #

Note that you need to have the same permissions to update an installation as you do to install. In general the user that does the installation should be the one that does the update. I.e. if you install as user then you can update as user but if you installed as root then you will NOT be able to update as user. In multi user scenarios the person who did the installation should be the one doing updates.

# Troubleshooting #

### Error "Please set DISPLAY. Code Composer Studio v5 cannot be installed in console mode." ###

Assuming DISPLAY is in fact set correctly then this error is caused by the 32bit library support package not being present. Install the necessary 32bit support libraries to resolve.

### Installer exits immediately without doing anything ###

This error is caused by the 32bit library support package not being present. Install the necessary 32bit support libraries to resolve.

### Failure installing 32bit libraries ###

Try running the OS update tool first. I have found on Fedora and later Ubuntu distributions that if my OS is not up to date then the libraries will fail to install.

### Missing menu ###

If using Ubuntu 10.10 or newer with the Unity Desktop framework (default in 11.x) the main menu in CCS to not appear. Instead unity puts the menu at the very top of the screen and you need to place your mouse there and it will appear.  Note that if you don't like this Unity feature the issue can be worked around by running CCS with the following command

- <tt>env UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 ccstudio</tt>
