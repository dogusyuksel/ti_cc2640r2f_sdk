This article describes how to use the zoom function in the Code Composer Studio editor to increase or decrease the size of the font.

You can change the font size settings in the **Preferences** dialog but sometimes you just want to quickly zoom the editor window.  Perhaps you are switching between screens that have different resolutions.

### Zoom In ###

To zoom the editor in press **Ctrl Shift +**

This will zoom the editor in each time you press that key combination.  Here you can see the editor text has been increased as compared to the text in the **Project Explorer**.
