#Ultra-Low Power (ULP) Advisor#

ULP Advisor is a static code analysis tool that scans source code against a thorough set of low-power coding rules to help squeeze every last nano amp out of your application.

ULP Advisor is enabled by default for MSP430 projects and can be enabled for ARM projects.  The analysis runs as part of the build.  Any notifications and remarks to highlight areas of code that can be further optimized will be displayed in the **Advice** view.

<br>
Selecting an item in the **Advice** view will open detailed information on the rule that triggered the advice as well as example code that shows how to improve the application for better power usage. It is then up to the developer to either act on the advice or leave their application as-is.
