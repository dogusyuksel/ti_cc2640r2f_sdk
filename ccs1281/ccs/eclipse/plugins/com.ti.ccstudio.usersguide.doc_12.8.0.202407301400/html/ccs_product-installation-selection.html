#Overview

For the purposes of this article, the term software products refers to Software Development Kits (SDK), SYS/BIOS, XDCtools, etc. Code Composer Studio (CCS) allows you to install and select different versions of these software products for building a project.

#Product Installation

The first step is to install the desired version of software product. This can be done from within the CCS environment or from outside the CCS environment. 

##Within CCS

The recommended method is to download/install software products within the CCS environment using [Resource Explorer](ccs_resource_explorer.html).

##Outside CCS

If the above method does not work, for some reason, or the desired software/version is not available in Resource Explorer, stand-alone installers can be downloaded from [TI web site](https://www.ti.com) (search for the desired product on the TI main page). 

Stand-alone installers for XDCtools and SYS/BIOS are available from the Target Content [download page](https://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/index.html).

#Product Discovery

After the product is installed, the next step is for CCS to discover the newly installed product.

CCS determines the list of installed products by searching the **Product discovery path**. To see which versions of products are installed go to menu **Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Code Composer Studio &rarr; Products**. The paths searched by default are added to the **Product discovery path** (highlighted in yellow) and the products installed to those paths are listed under **Installed products**.

If new products are installed from Resource Explorer (either desktop or online) into the default location (c:\ti), they will be automatically discovered by CCS. 

If new products are installed outside CCS, you can configure CCS to discover it using the steps below.  

If the software is installed to one of the paths already listed in the **Product discovery path** it will be automatically discovered during the next restart of CCS. You can also manually initiate the discovery by clicking **Rediscover** next to the **Installed products** dialog. CCS will display the list of products available to install. You can select the products you wish to install and click **Install**.

If the software is installed to a path different from the ones in the **Product discovery path**, you can add the root location of the product installation to the list of discovery paths:

- Go to menu **Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Code Composer Studio &rarr; Products**.
- Click the **Add** button next to **Product discovery path** and browse to the location where the product is installed.

Once the new path has been added, CCS will rescan the discovery paths and refresh the **Product discovery path** dialog. The newly installed product will now appear in the list of **Installed products**.

#Product Selection

Any product that is installed into CCS can be selected as the version to use when building a project.

- Right-click on the project in **Project Explorer** view and select **Properties**.
- Click on **General** in left pane.
- Go to **Products** tab.
- Select the desired version of product and/or XDCtools from the list of versions provided. <br> The version selected here will be used during project build.
