When contacting TI for support, in addition to the usual information, providing the following additional diagnostics logs can help support personnel in their investigations:

* Install Logs
* Eclipse/JVM Error Logs
* Crash Dump Files
* Debug Server Logs
* Java Thread Dump Logs
* Internal JxBrowser Logs
* Eclipse Debug Logs
* cTools/Trace Logs


Many of these logs can be accessed from the <strong>CCS Support</strong> utility (<strong>Help &rarr; CCS Support</strong>):

![](./images/ccs_support_dialog.png)

From the above dialog are options to view various logs (<strong>View</strong> button), clear the log (<strong>Clear</strong>) and to enable logging (<strong>Properties...</strong>). Only the Debug Server Log is not enabled by default. To enable it, highlight it and click on <strong>Properties</strong>, check the box to <strong>Enable Debug Server Logging</strong> and specify a location to save the log file. There is also a button to <strong>Archive Logs...</strong>. This will zip up all the enabled logs to a location on your machine. This zip file can then be sent to TI support personnel. 

[[y Debug Server Logs
Enabling Debug Server Logging will slow overall CCS performance, so it is not recommended to leave logging enabled. If you are unable to provide a reproducible test case to TI support, you can enable Debug Server Logging to generate additional diagnostics logs. These logs will only be useful for issues related to the debug server (ex: unable to connect to the target, debugger hangs, etc) and useless for other issues like project build errors or issues with the editor. Logging data from the debugger can get very large, so it may be desirable to only enable Debug Server Logging just before the event of interest is being exercised.

cTools/Trace logging is not accessible from the <strong>CCS Support</strong> utility. Please see the related [section](#ctools-trace-logging) below.

### CCS Installation Logs

The above dialog only sends the main installation log. However, there are other related logs that may also be useful. All the installation logs can be found in: <tt>[CCS INSTALL DIR]/ccsv[x]/install_logs</tt>

### Debug Server Logs

In addition to using the CCS Support utility, Debug Server Logging can also be enabled using the following techniques:

#### Scripting Console

Enter the following command in the [Scripting Console](https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccs_scripting_console_view.html) to enable Debug Server Logging: <tt>eval("DEBUG_LogEnable(1)")</tt> 

You can specify where to save the logs by entering, for example, <tt>eval("DEBUG_LogRedirect(\"c:/temp/ds.log\")")</tt> prior to the command above:
![](./images/ccs_ds_log_scripting_console.png)

#### Command Line

If you wish to enable logging outside CCS (useful if you are using [DSS](https://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/users_guide/sdto_dss_handbook.html)), you can use the below environment variables (example for Windows):

```bat
set TI_DS_ENABLE_LOGGING=1
set TI_DS_LOGGING_OUTPUT=c:/path/file.log
```

The former enables logging, the latter will let you choose where the log is generated. Make sure you clear the first variable after the logging is done.

[[y WARNING
<strong>TI_DS_LOGGING_OUTPUT</strong> must specify an actual file name inside an existing directory. While the file of that name itself does not need to exist (the Debug Server can generate a new file), the containing folder must currently exist.

### CCS Java Thread Dump Logs

When a CCS hang occurs, it can be challenging to get a reproducible use case. However, if a hang can be somewhat reproduced without clear steps, then it is possible to collect a java thread dump, which will list all java threads and their call stacks. 

The easiest way to collect this is to start CCS from command line with <tt>-console</tt> option

* Open a Command window, navigate to where the <tt>ccstudio</tt> binary is: <tt>[CCS INSTALL DIR]/ccsv[x]/eclipse</tt> 
* execute <tt>ccstudio -console</tt> 
    * Alternatively, you may add the <tt>-console</tt> option to the <tt>cstudio.ini</tt> file before <tt>-vmargs</tt>. With this modification, you can then just double click on ccstudio binary or use the desktop shortcuts. 
    * **NOTE: CCS 11.x requires a slightly different method to be able to trigger a thread dump**
        * <tt>ccstudio -console</tt> no longer works for CCS 11.x. Users will need to start ccs using the <tt>eclipsec</tt> launcher from Command Window, with no arguments being necessary. User may then trigger thread dump using **CTRL+BREAK**
* This should open a new command window that shows additional messages 
* Use CCS as normal to reproduce the issue.
* Once a hang occurs, activate the window titled <tt>ccstudio -console</tt> and hit **CTRL+Break** combination (depending on your keyboard you may need to use **FN** key)
    * For Dell Laptops, there is no Break key.  Use **Ctrl+Fn+B**

This should generate a thread dump that looks similar to picture below:

![](./images/ccs_diag_log_thread_dump.png)

You can get copy the output and save to a file to submit with your bug report. 

It maybe useful to collect 2-3 thread dumps by pressing **CTRL+Break** at 10-15 second intervals. If the stack is always the same, then it most likely indicates a deadlock, If there are some changes in a particular thread, then it may indicate that a particular thread is busy performing tasks. 

### Internal JxBrowser Logs

The internal JxBrowser browser is used by various functions inside CCS, such as **Resource Explorer** and **Getting Started** views. 

Open the file <tt>ccs/eclipse/ccstudio.ini</tt> in a text editor and add the below lines:

<pre>
-Djxbrowser.logging.level=ALL
-Djxbrowser.logging.file=[PATH]/jxbrowser.log
</pre>

[PATH] must be an existing directory with read/write permissions.

### Eclipse Debug Logs

Is is possible to launch the CCS IDE in a debug mode where all internal debug messages will be sent to a separate console. This is useful for debugging CCS/Eclipse IDE crashes/errors. 

To launch CCS in debug mode, launch the ccstudio executable from the command line with the following parameters:

<tt>
> [CCS INSTALL DIR]/ccs/eclipse/ccstudio -debug -consoleLog
</tt>

<br>

This will open a separate debug console in addition to the CCS IDE. When an error or crash occures, check the debug console for any errors. The  relevant error messages can then be copied to a file and provided to TI support.

### cTools/Trace Logging

To generate a cTools/Trace log, set the <strong>TI_TRACE_LOGGING</strong> environment variable to the value of <strong>6</strong>.

```bat
set TI_TRACE_LOGGING=6
```

Then reproduce the issue as you would for a Debug Server Log.

The log file will get generated in <tt>/Users/[userid]/.TI-trace</tt> on Windows and <tt>~/.TI-trace</tt> on Linux. The file name will have the following format: <strong>ti_trace_log_MMDDYY_PID.txt</strong>
