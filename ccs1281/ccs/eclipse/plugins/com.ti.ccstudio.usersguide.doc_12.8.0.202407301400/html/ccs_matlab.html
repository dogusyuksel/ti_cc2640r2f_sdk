[MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com), creator of [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html), and [Embedded Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/products/embedded-coder.html) offers support for CCS. There are two main workflows, defined by the Embedded Coder system target file used: **idelink_ert.tlc** and **ert.tlc**.

**ert.tlc** is the primary workflow - you use Embedded Coder to generate C/C++ code from your model and then you import into an existing CCS project. This is supported for CCSv3.3 and onwards. This workflow is suitable for a wide variety of TI MCU's and DSP's including C2000, C6000, etc.

**idelink_ert.tlc** includes a direct interface to the CCS IDE, but is based on older CCSv3.3 technology. This workflow is not recommended for new customers or projects. It is supported for CCSv3.3, with only partial support for CCSv4 and CCSv5. It is not supported at all for CCSv6 and onwards.

[[y NOTE
Support for **idelink_ert.tlc** workflows will be removed, starting in MathWorks Release R2017a.
