# Overview #
This page contains information regarding Code Composer Studio Theia running on Linux. It includes installation instructions, device support and debug probe support.

Due to the wide variety of Linux distributions and versions available, it is impossible to support all of them. CCS Theia is tested in a small subset ordered by popularity, but over the years the developers helped populate this list by providing information on how to install in various additional distributions. This information is added to this page, therefore always check back for updates. 

Please note that Code Composer Studio Theia is a 64-bit application and will not run on 32-bit distributions.

# Distribution Validation #

CCS Theia is validated on a defined set of Linux distributions.  Typically these are active Ubuntu LTS versions.

CCS Theia is validated on:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS 
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 

# Installation Instructions  #

CCS Theia requires a 64-bit distribution of Linux. 32-bit distributions are not supported.

CCS Theia has dependencies on several libraries being installed on the system. The CCS Theia installer will run a dependency check for these and inform the user of any missing dependencies.

Please resolve **all** unresolved dependencies reported by the installer before continuing with the installation.

<font color="#FF0000"><b>IMPORTANT!</b></font> TI performs testing on actively supported Ubuntu LTS distributions <b>only</b>. For other versions of Linux distributions, consider these releases as <b>unsupported</b> and <b>untested</b> with CCS.

### After Installation ### 

If CCS Theia was installed as user, then it is necessary to run the driver install script after the installation is complete:
   - go to &lt;CCS_THEIA_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/ccs/install_scripts
   - <tt>sudo ./install_drivers.sh</tt>

## Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 LTS ##
- update system: <tt>sudo apt update</tt>
- install dependent libraries: <tt>sudo apt install libc6-i386 libusb-0.1-4 libgconf-2-4 libncurses5 libpython2.7 libtinfo5</tt>
- install CCS Theia
- run the driver install script
   - go to &lt;CCS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/ccs/install_scripts
   - <tt>sudo ./install_drivers.sh</tt>

## Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ##
   - will work with 24.04 LTS.
      - Please note that CCS is not officially tested/supported on this version.     
   - following dependent libraries need to installed first:
      - libc6-i386
      - libusb-0.1-4
      - libtinfo5 (please note that Ubuntu 24.04 comes with libtinfo6. CCS Theia requires libtinfo5, which is obsolete with Ubuntu 24.04. The package for 22.04 can be obtained from https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy-updates/libtinfo5 and the *.deb file can be installed manually ).
   - install CCS Theia   
   - run the driver install script mentioned earlier as needed
   - browse to: &lt;CCS THEIA INSTALL DIR&gt;/ccs/theia; and run the below commands:
      - <tt>sudo chown root chrome-sandbox</tt>
      - <tt>chomd 4755 chrome-sandbox</tt>

# Proxy server considerations #

Certain functions of Code Composer Studio Theia require access to the Internet. In general, this works well for connections that do not require a proxy server, but in certain cases its use is mandatory by the corporate IT department.  

Linux poses a challenge to configure proxy servers due to the nature of its various components and where they inherit its settings. For example, it is not uncommon to have a web browser fully connected to the internet while the aptitude or yum utilities (used to install system features or dependencies) is unable to do so. 

In this case, it is important to observe a few aspects during CCS Theia setup and runtime. 
- The system update utility (apt, yum, etc.) has its own configuration files to set up a proxy, typically text files under the subdirectory /etc. To properly configure these utilities, please refer to your distro instructions. 
- The system wide proxy setting is usually accessible via the GUI of choice (Gnome, KDE, etc.) and is normally present under the Network settings. This setting is inherited by the Theia features of Code Composer Studio, namely the ability to access its update sites to update the various components of an install (compilers, emupack, etc.)
- The shell environment variable <tt>http_proxy</tt> (and its counterparts <tt>https_proxy</tt> and <tt>ftp_proxy</tt> not used by CCS Theia) are inherited by the browser built into Code Composer Studio Theia to access its online content and download the various SDK packages. In general this environment variable is set at the system wide shell init script (<tt>/etc/bash.bashrc</tt>, for example) but this can also be set by each user on its local shell <tt>~/.bashrc</tt>. 
   - The scope where this configuration will reach is highly dependent on the install and definitely some experimentation is necessary. 
   - In this case, experimentation can be done by setting the environment variable exclusively during the invocation of Code Composer Studio Theia from a command line. For example, from a bash shell the proxy environment variable can be set prior to running CCS Theia as:

   **user@host:~/ti/ccstheia140/ccs/theia$** <tt>http_proxy=myproxy.mycompany.com:80 ./ccstudio &</tt>
