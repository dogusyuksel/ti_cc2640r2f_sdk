#Overview
The XDS560v2 is the second generation of the XDS560-class technology of Debug Probes, which features the most advanced features and the highest performance of all XDS Debug Probes from TI. It is divided into two main categories:

##XDS560v2 STM
The <b>XDS560v2 System Trace Emulator</b> (STM) is the second generation of the XDS560-class emulators. It provides cost effective real-time emulation, debugging, and high-performance System Trace (STM) for Texas Instruments devices over both USB and Ethernet PC interfaces.

The System Trace (STM) capability is a set of built-in capabilities on the device that monitors synchronization and timing between cores and on-chip peripherals either configured via the Trace features of Code Composer Studio or built into the application (by using the library Ctoolslib). This has multiple uses: the ability to track bus and peripheral activity, monitor and benchmark data throughput, transfer debug messages through the JTAG channel (via modified printf or putc routines) and more.

[[b Note:
This is different than <i>Core Trace</i> or <i>Instruction Trace</i>, which is the emulation technology that performs real-time gathering of all instructions being executed in a processor. All XDS Debug Probes support core/instruction trace to ETB (Embedded Trace Buffer), however for the streaming of these traces please check the [XDS560v2 ProTrace](emu_protrace.html) page.
]]

This is available with selected CTools enabled devices, also named Chip Tools. They are system level debug facilities included on selected TI devices. They provide system level visibility and capabilities. CTools is compliant to Mobile Industry Processor Interface System Trace Protocol or MIPI STP for short and aid users in understanding the synchronization and timing between cores and peripherals as well as the performance of cores and key device interfaces. See www.mipi.org for more details.

##XDS560v2 ProTrace
The <b>XDS560v2 ProTrace</b> is the next generation of Trace Receiver products that replaced the XDS560T. Although it is also capable of performing regular Debug activities, its main differential is to capture high-speed Core Trace data exported from the pins of TI devices to enable advanced analysis.

Check additional details at the [XDS560v2 ProTrace page](emu_xdsprotrace.html).

#Features

##Debug

- Code Composer Studio
- Native 60 pin MIPI HSPT target cable, with adapters to: 20 pin compact TI, 14 pin TI, and 20 pin ARM connectors
- Target debugging with JTAG (IEEE 1149.1) and IEEE 1149.7
- Up to 50 MHz TCLK
- Control for power-up/boot-mode on EMU0/1 pins
- Auto sensing target voltage range from 1.2 volts to 4.1 volts
- Approx 50% faster code download than XDS560 (v1)
- <b>JTAG debug isolation mode</b> - ability to disconnect the emulator connection and have this result in the debug subsystem power down. This blocks driving any JTAG signals by the emulator/cable when CCS is not connected.
   - When the last CCS core/node disconnects, all the emulator/cable output signals will be tri-stated (Hi-Z). This blocks driving any JTAG signals by the emulator/cable.

- <b>JTAG TCLK loop-back option</b> - ability to select TCLK loop-back with user-specified limit
   - This enables CCS to connect to targets with no return clock (RTCK) pin.

- <b>Map boot-mode pins (EMU0 &amp; EMU1)</b> - ability to map boot-mode pins to any of the following pins
   - EMU1 = Pin TRD0.2 and EMU0 = Pin TRD0.1
   - EMU1 = Pin TRD0.1 and EMU0 = Pin TRD0.0
   - EMU1 = Pin EXTF and EMU0 = Pin EXTE

##System Trace (STM)

- Support for 1-4 pin System Trace with up to 100 MHz export clock (System Trace is compliant to MIPI STP)
- 128 MBytes System Trace buffer storage
- Auto compensating calibration for edge jitter, channel skews and duty cycle for robust trace data capture
- Adaptive receiver technology supporting setup/hold times up to 1.5ns
- Available on selected CTools enabled devices

##PC Interfaces
The interfaces available vary by model.  Most offer a USB2.0 high speed interface and some additionally offer Ethernet.

#Hardware
##Target Board Connector Requirements

- The XDS560v2 System Trace Emulator utilizes the 60-pin MIPI HSPT connector. The connector and target board electrical requirements and recommandation for Trace and JTAG support can be found in [XDS Target Connection Guide](./emu_xds_target_connection_guide.html).
- Also see your Emulator manufacturer's documentation for emulator specific information. Users may also want to read the "Common Trace Transmission Problems and Solutions" at [SPRAAK6](https://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/SPRAAK6).
- MIPI Connector recommendation can be found at [MIPI.org](https://mipi.org/docs/MIPI_TD_connectors_recommendation_v01-00-00.pdf).
- 20 pin compact TI connector can be used for System Trace as it has 4 pins for data and 1 pin for clock (EMU0-5).
- TI 14 pin can be used, but can only carry 1 pin data and 1 pin clock (EMU0/1)
- ARM 20 pin connectors should NOT be used for CTools System Trace enabled devices as it does not carry signals for System Trace.

With more recent versions of XDS560v2 firmware user1 is unaffected and user2 will receive the "Error initializing emulator" message.

##Q: Does the XDS560v2 support High Speed RTDX?

No.

##Q: What do the LEDs mean on the XDS560v2 System Trace Debug Probe enclosure?

Check the documentation of your Debug Probe for the most accurate details, but in general they obey the following convention:

<table id="stl01">
<tr>
<th> <font color="#0000f0"> <b>LED Name</b> </font> </th>
<th> <font color="#0000f0"> <b>Color</b> </font> </th>
<th> <font color="#0000f0"> <b>Operation</b> </font> </th>
</tr>
<tr> <th>POWER</th> <th><span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 102);">Green </span></th> <th>ON- Power ON<br>OFF - Power Off</th> </tr>
<tr> <th>STATE-1</th> <th><span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 102);">Green </span></th> <th>ON - CCS debugger connected<br>OFF- CCS debugger disconnected </th> </tr>

<tr> <th>ACTIVITY-3<br>ACTIVITY-2<br>STATE-1 </th> <th>Flashing</th> <th>SAFE MODE.  When all three are simultaneously flashing this indicates safe mode.  The likely causes are a failed firmware upgrade, or multiple failed boot attempts. See the FAQ section below.</th> </tr>
<tr>
</table>

[[b Notes:
1. While booting into SAFE MODE the <span style="color: rgb(51, 153, 102);">green </span>ACTIVITY-1 LED and the <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">red </span>STATE-3 LED will both be ON.<br>

2. Only one ethernet client may use the XDS560v2 System Trace Debug Probe at a time.  The ethernet connection will be refused if another client is already connected in CCS.  In this case the error message will be "Error initializing Debug Probe".

##Q: What version of Code composer Studio is supported?

The XDS560v2 System Trace Debug Probe supports Code Composer Studio v4.2 and newer.

##Q: Is Code Composer Studio v3.3 supported?

No.

##Q: What utility can I use to configure my Spectrum Digital XDS560v2 System Trace or XDS560v2 ProTrace?
Spectrum Digital provides the utility SD560v2Config.exe, which is installed with CCS and can be found at the directory below:

   &lt;CCS_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/ccs/ccs_base/common/uscif

The manual is available from the menu **Help** &rarr; **Documentation** from within the utility.
#Troubleshooting
##Q: How do I make sure that the XDS560v2 System Trace emulator is ready to use and functional?

- Once the POWER, STATE-2 and the STATE-3 LEDs are ON (all of them), XDS560v2 System Trace Debug Probe is ready to use.
- The **dtc_conf** configuration utility can also be used. Check the [DTC CONF](emu_dtc_conf.html) document for details.

##Q: The LEDs are flashing and I can't connect to the XDS560v2 System Trace Debug Probe in CCS, what does this mean?

This means the XDS560v2 System Trace Debug Probe is unable to boot properly. It may be either in safe mode or some hardware failure took place.

Scenarios where this may happen are a failed firmware update or a failure to properly boot multiple times.

The **dtc_conf** configuration utility can be used to put the Debug Probe out of the safe mode. Check the [DTC CONF](emu_dtc_conf.html) document for details.


##Q: When I launch CCS and try to connect, I see "Emulator not initialized" error message. What could be wrong? <br>

Check the section **Host connection error** of the [Debugging JTAG](../ccs_debugging_jtag_connectivity_issues.html) page.

##Q: How can I check if the USB driver is setup correctly?

You should be able to look in Windows Devices to see if it is setup properly. It should look like below when USB is setup correctly.

![XDS560v2 Windows Control Panel](./images/Sdusbsetupok.jpg)

##Q: Ethernet isn't working but USB is what could be wrong with ethernet?

The Ethernet connection may not have been initialized. Connect the Ethernet cable before powering up the Debug Probe. This is due to an issue where the automatic Ethernet cable detection fails to work after the system finished booting.

The network and the Debug Probe may have mismatched configurations. Check the [DTC CONF](emu_dtc_conf.html) document for details on how to configure the proper address lease mechanism: DHCP or static IP.

Also, versions prior to and including epkRev 5.0.329.0 have a bug that can cause certain values of the dtcName variable to prevent ethernet from starting. Issue the command below to obtain the epk version and, if older, issue the second command to change the dtcName to an alphanumeric name:

C:\ti\ccs1010\ccs\ccs\_base\common\uscif&gt; **dtc_conf get sd560v2u 0 epkRev**
C:\ti\ccs1010\ccs\ccs\_base\common\uscif&gt; **dtc_conf set sd560v2u 0 "dtcName=Probe1"**

Check the [DTC CONF](emu_dtc_conf.html) document for details.

##Q: Why the XDS560v2 Pro Trace seems to be slower than my XDS560v2 System Trace?

Due to design constraints, the XDS560v2 Pro Trace uses a slower TCLK frequency up to 6.25MHz when compared to the faster 50MHz of the XDS560v2 System Trace pod.

##Q: When I try to start the Trace Control I get the "Target is disconnected" error message, what could be wrong?

This usually means that a device that was previously connected has been disconnected. Ensure that all the devices are connected by selecting the device in the tree list and pressing the Connect button.

##Q: I get the "failed to calibrate channel : no signal on clock : check external pin manager settings and clock circuit connection" error message from the Trace Control, what could be wrong?

The message indicates that no target transmitter clock was detected during the receiver calibration. This usually means that the external pin manager has not been enabled, requiring to assign and run the appropriate GEL script commands for your device. Some devices such as 66AK2H12 or 66AK2E05 require this to be done manually, but others feature a platform target configuration such as K2GEVM or IDK_AM572X, where these scripts are pre-configured.

##Q: I do not see the STM node in the CCS debug view even if I have this setup in the CCS setup configuration.

This is probably caused by not turning on option to view non-debuggable devices. This option can be turned on from CCS debug view options. Once the option is checked, you need to re-launch the debugger.

##Q: What if someone is already using the Debug Probe via ethernet? / What does "SC_ERR_OCS_ALREADY_OPEN" mean?

If someone is already using the Debug Probe on ethernet, you may get an error message like SC_ERR_OCS_ALREADY_OPEN. This means someone already has a connection to the Debug Probe.

##Q: How can I confirm the IP or the USB address of the XDS560v2 unit I am trying to access?

When using DTC_CONF, the ACTIVITY-1 LED should blink briefly.

##Q: When trying to use SD560v2Config.exe I get the message "Application Error: The application has failed to initialize properly (0xc0000135). Click on OK to terminate the application."

The problem is that .NET is not installed on your computer. Download and install [Microsoft .NET 3.5 Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&displaylang=en) to fix the problem.
