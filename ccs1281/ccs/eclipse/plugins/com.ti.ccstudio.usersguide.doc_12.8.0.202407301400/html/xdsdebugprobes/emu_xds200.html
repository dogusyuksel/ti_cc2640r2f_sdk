#Introduction
The XDS200 is the midrange family of JTAG debug probes (emulators) for TI processors. Designed to deliver good performance and the most common features that place it between the low cost [XDS110](./emu_xds110.html) and the high performance [XDS560v2](./emu_xds560v2.html), the XDS200 is the balanced solution to debug TI Simplelink microcontrollers and embedded processors.

The XDS200 is designed to replace the aging XDS510 family of JTAG debuggers with higher JTAG data throughput, added support for ARM Serial Wire debug modes, IEEE1149.7 (cJTAG) and reduced cost.

Following the trend for space reduction on modern TI development boards, all XDS200 variants feature a standard TI 20-pin connector as the primary JTAG connectivity to the target. In addition to that, all variants also feature modular target configuration adapters for TI and ARM standard JTAG headers (the offer of adapters varies per model).

The XDS200 family is fully compatible with TI's Code Composer Studio IDE. This combination gives a complete hardware development environment which includes an Integrated Debug Environment, Compiler, and full hardware debugging and Trace capability on selected TI microcontrollers, processors and wireless connectivity microcontrollers.
XDS200 is the midrange class of JTAG debuggers for Texas Instruments' microcontrollers and embedded processors. 

XDS200 is compatible with Code Composer Studio (CCS) version 5.2.0 and newer.

#Updating the firmware
When installing a newer release of CCS or updating the <I>TI Emulators</I> component of CCS (details on the [XDS Emulation Software Package page](emu_xds_software_package_download.html) or [Updating CCS](../ccsv7_updates.html), keep in mind you may need to update the firmware of your JTAG debugger. 

[[r IMPORTANT!
Very old firmware releases such as the ones present in Keystone II EVMs (1.0.0.2) are known to have problems updating. In general they work well in Windows, therefore proceed with the update at your own risk as the JTAG debugger may be bricked and only recoverable by returning the board for repair.

If you accidentally bricked your onboard XDS200 Debug Probe, please check the section [Re-flash the firmware of onboard XDS200 units](#re-flash-the-firmware-of-onboard-xds200-units-) below.
]]

To update a XDS200-class JTAG debugger connected via USB, <u>using a Windows host is highly recommended</u>. Close any instances of CCS that are running in your system. Open a Windows Command Prompt and issue the following commands:

#Finding and updating the serial number
When using multiple debug probes in the same host, it is necessary to set different serial numbers and enable its usage on the Debug Probe firmware.  

To find out what is the serial number of all connected debug probes, follow steps 1 and 2 above, then locate the option <b>serialNum</b>

If you want to set the serial number to a specific value:
- Unplug all other debug probes from the host
- Follow steps 1 and 2 above
- Enable the option <b>EnableUSBSerial</b> by issuing the following:

   C:\ti\ccs1000\ccs\ccs_base\common\uscif\xds2xx><b>xds2xx_conf set xds2xxu 0 EnableUSBSerial=true</b>

- Then set the serial number:

   C:\ti\ccs1000\ccs\ccs_base\common\uscif\xds2xx><b>xds2xx_conf set xds2xxu 0 serialNum=00:11:22:33:44:55</b>

At this point you may unplug this probe and repeat the operation for the subsequent probes. 

For details on how to configure Code Composer Studio to use the multiple Debug Probes, please check the document [Debugging with Multiple Debug Probes](../sdto_ccs_multi-probe-debug.html)

#Debug and Trace Usage Modes
The XDS200 allows using multiple modes of operation through the option <i>JTAG / SWD / cJTAG Mode</i> of the Target Configuration Editor:
![Advanced JTAG modes option](./images/XDS200_Advanced_tag_JTAG_Mode_option.PNG)

##JTAG
JTAG is the standard IEEE1149.1 4-wire debug protocol that is used by the majority of TI devices. When in doubt, this is usually a safe option. 
- 4 pin debug (TDI, TDO, TMS, TCLK)
- Supports TVRef

##SWD/SWO
Serial Wire Debug (SWD) is a debug mode that also uses two pins and transfers data at a higher clock rate when compared to JTAG. Serial Wire Output (SWO) adds one more pin that allows performing simple Trace operations on selected Cortex M4 microcontrollers.

SWD: Serial Wire Debug

- 2 pin debug: SWDIO/TMS and SWCLK/TCLK 

SWO: Serial Wire Output
- 1 pin trace (SWO/TDO) 
- Supported only by DAP based devices like MSP432 which have DAP as the toplevel router in the scan chain. 
- SWO trace can be obtained in UART or Manchester format. XDS200 only supports UART format. The TDO/SWO pin is routed to a UART on the debug processor (Snowflake) during SWO capture.
   - <b>SWO (ITM) Usesecases:</b>
      - Function profiling (DWT - Data Watchpoint and Trace) 
      - Data variable trace (DWT - Data Watchpoint and Trace) 
      - Interrupt profiling (DWT - Data Watchpoint and Trace) 
      - Software messages (ITM - Instrumentation Trace Macrocell)

For additional details about Trace via SWO, check the following resources:
- [ITM for Cortex M video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG_i_uln6Es)
- ITM training: [CCSv6](../../training/modules/itm/CCSv6-InstrumentationTraceModule.pptx) or [CCSv5](../../training/modules/itm/CCSv5-InstrumentationTraceModule.pptx)

##cJTAG
IEEE1149.7 or Compact JTAG (cJTAG) is a major improvement over the traditional JTAG, as it supports all its features while using only two pins, and is available in selected TI wireless connectivity microcontrollers.

- 2 and 4 pin modes
- 6 OSCAN modes
- Supported by selected Wireless Connectivity devices such as CC13xx, CC25xx, CC26xx and CC32xx families.


#Troubleshooting
- Check whether the installation process was followed.

- If the CCS debug fails, search for the error message number on the [Debugging JTAG](../ccs_debugging_jtag_connectivity_issues.html) page.

- Check if the device drivers were properly instantiated. Check the screenshot below to see how they show up on Windows. 

![XDS200 on Windows Control Panel](./images/XDS200onWin10_sysdevices.png) 

##To reinstall the Windows device drivers:
- Open the Windows Control Panel
- Expand the node <b>Ports (COM & LPT)</b>
- Right-click on node <b>XDS2xx Emulator CDC Serial Port</b>
- Select <b>Update Driver Software</b> &rarr; <b>Browse my computer for driver software</b>
- Select <b>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</b>. If the drivers are already installed, the <b>XDS2xx Emulator CDC Serial Port Version: M.m.m.m [mm/dd/yyyy]</b> will be shown. Select this one. Otherwise, repeat but skip this step. 
- Click on Browse and select the directory C:\ti\ccs1000\ccs\ccs_base\emulation\windows\xds2xx_drivers
- Repeat for <b>XDS2xx User CDC Serial Port</b>

That should get you the same driver as installed by CCS.

If Windows refuses to update the driver, they need to be fully removed. 

- Right-click on node <b>XDS2xx Emulator CDC Serial Port</b>
- Select <b>Uninstall...</b>
- Check the box <b>Delete the driver software for this device</b> and click <b>OK</b>
- Repeat for <b>XDS2xx User CDC Serial Port</b>
- Do the procedure above to reinstall the drivers

##What are the known issues?
- Ubuntu 18.04.2 and newer
   - When updating an existing Ubuntu host that uses version 18.04.2 and newer, a change in the default policy setting of the ModemManager component causes the XDS200 to be inoperative. To workaround this issue, please check [this e2e thread](https://e2e.ti.com/support/tools/ccs/f/81/p/808746/3021888#3021888).
- USB3.0 and Linux and Mac OSX
   - When connected to USB3.0 ports and hubs in Linux OSes, XDS200 JTAG debuggers are not able to properly be initialized by the low-level device drivers.  If you update to the latest "TI emulators" package and update the firmware on the xds200 pod then you can connected it to a USB3 port with Linux.  Note that if you only have USB3 ports on your computer then you will need to use Windows to update the firmware as the software has to be able to detect the pod to update it.
- There are reported issues when connecting a XDS200 to a bus powered USB2.0 hub. To repair that, either get a self powered hub or connect it directly to a port in the computer.
- When connected to USB3.0 Renesas adapter on Windows, XDS200 fails to properly initialize - check [this e2e post](https://e2e.ti.com/support/development_tools/code_composer_studio/f/81/p/433059/1555899#1555899) for details.
- There is a tendency of Windows device drivers to ignore the connected XDS200 JTAG debugger if it is connected to the same USB port repeatedly. Reconnecting the XDS200 to a different USB port makes the device drivers to be properly instantiated. 
- Issues were found when connecting a XDS200 with a firmware older than 1.0.0.6 on MacOS X and certain Linux distros - the error thrown is typically a [Host connection error](../ccs_debugging_jtag_connectivity_issues.html#host-connection-error). At the moment the only way to workaround this is to update the firmware version on a Windows PC. 
- Not an issue, but a common usability trait. Certain boards have onboard XDS200 JTAG debuggers, but the configuration is easy to miss.

- Not a issue, but a compatibility break. One of the released TI emulation components (5.1.600.0) breaks compatibility with XDS200 JTAG debuggers and previous releases of CCS. Details are shown at the [XDS Emulation Software Package page](emu_xds_software_package_download.html). Release (6.1.636.0) and newer solves this issue.
