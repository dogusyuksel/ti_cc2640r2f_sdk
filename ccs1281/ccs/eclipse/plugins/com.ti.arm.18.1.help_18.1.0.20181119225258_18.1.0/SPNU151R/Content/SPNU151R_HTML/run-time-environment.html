                                <p>This chapter describes the <span>ARM</span> C/C++ run-time environment. To ensure successful execution of C/C++ programs, it is critical that all run-time code maintain this environment. It is also important to follow the guidelines in this chapter if you write assembly language functions that interface with C/C++ code.</p>

                                <p>The ARM compiler treats memory as a single linear block that is partitioned into subblocks of code and data. Each subblock of code or data generated by a C program is placed in its own continuous memory space. The compiler assumes that a full 32-bit address space is available in target memory.</p>
                                <span class="note">
                                    <p class="note_title">NOTE</p>
                                    <b>The Linker Defines the Memory Map</b>
                                    <p>The linker, not the compiler, defines the memory map and allocates code and data into target memory. The compiler assumes nothing about the types of memory available, about any locations not available for code or data (holes), or about any locations reserved for I/O or control purposes. The compiler produces relocatable code that allows the linker to allocate code and data into the appropriate memory spaces. For example, you can use the linker to allocate global variables into on-chip RAM or to allocate executable code into external ROM. You can allocate each block of code or data individually into memory, but this is not a general practice (an exception to this is memory-mapped I/O, although you can access physical memory locations with C/C++ pointer types).</p>

                                        <span class="section-label">6.1.1 </span>Sections</h4>
                                    <p>The compiler produces relocatable blocks of code and data called <i>sections</i>. The sections are allocated into memory in a variety of ways to conform to a variety of system configurations. For more information about sections and allocating them, see the introductory object file information in the <i> <span>ARM </span>Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i>.</p>
                                    <p>There are two basic types of sections:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">
                                            <b>Initialized sections</b> contain data or executable code. Initialized sections are usually, but not always, read-only. The C/C++ compiler creates the following initialized sections: <ul><li value="1">The <b>.binit section </b> contains boot time copy tables. This is a read-only section. For details on BINIT, see the <i><span>ARM </span> Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i> for linker command file information. </li><li value="2">The <b>.init_array section</b> contains global constructor tables.</li><li id="t365164-2" value="3">The <b>.ovly section </b> contains copy tables other than boot time (.binit) copy tables. This is a read-only section.</li><li value="4">The <b>.data section</b> contains initialized global and static variables.</li><li value="5">The <b>.const section</b> contains read-only data, typically string constants and static-scoped objects defined with the C/C++ qualifier <i>const</i>. Note that not all static-scoped objects marked "const" are placed in the .const section (see <span class="crossreference"><a href="arm-c-c-language-implementation.html#STDZ0558110">Section 5.6.1</a></span>). This is a read-only section.</li><li id="t365164-3" value="6">contains string constants and data defined with the C/C++ qualifier <i>const</i> (provided the constant is not also defined as <i>volatile</i>). </li><li value="7">The<b> .text section</b> contains all the executable code. It also contains string literals, switch tables, and compiler-generated constants. This section is usually read-only. Note that some string literals may instead be placed in .const:.string. The placement of string literals depends on the size of the string and the use of the --embedded_constants option.</li><li value="8">The <b>.TI.crctab section </b> contains CRC checking tables. This is a read-only section.</li></ul></li>
                                        <li value="2">
                                            <b>Uninitialized sections</b> reserve space in memory (usually RAM). A program can use this space at run time to create and store variables. The compiler creates the following uninitialized sections: <ul><li value="1">For EABI only, the <b>.bss section</b> reserves space for uninitialized global and static variables. Uninitialized variables that are also unused are usually created as common symbols (unless you specify --common=off) instead of being placed in .bss so that they can be excluded from the resulting application.</li><li value="2">The <b>.stack section</b> reserves memory for the <span>C/C++ software stack.</span></li><li value="3">The <b>.sysmem section</b> reserves space for dynamic memory allocation. The reserved space is used by dynamic memory allocation routines, such as malloc, calloc, realloc, or new. If a C/C++ program does not use these functions, the compiler does not create the .sysmem section.</li></ul></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The assembler creates the default sections .text, <span>.bss</span>, and .data. You can instruct the compiler to create additional sections by using the CODE_SECTION and DATA_SECTION pragmas (see <span class="crossreference"><a href="arm-c-c-language-implementation.html#STDZ0557271">Section 5.10.5</a></span> and <span class="crossreference"><a href="arm-c-c-language-implementation.html#STDZ0559962">Section 5.10.8</a></span>).</p>
                                    <p>The linker takes the individual sections from different object files and combines sections that have the same name. The resulting output sections and the appropriate placement in memory for each section are listed in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0542560">Table 6-1</a></span>. You can place these output sections anywhere in the address space as needed to meet system requirements. </p>

                                    <p> The C/C++ compiler uses a stack to:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">Allocate local variables</li>
                                        <li value="2">Pass arguments to functions</li>
                                        <li value="3">Save register contents</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The run-time stack grows from the high addresses to the low addresses. The compiler uses the R13 register to manage this stack. R13 is the <i>stack pointer</i> (SP), which points to the next unused location on the stack.</p>
                                    <p>The linker sets the stack size, creates a global symbol, __STACK_SIZE, and assigns it a value equal to the stack size in bytes. The default stack size is 2048 bytes. You can change the stack size at link time by using the --stack_size option with the linker command. For more information on the --stack_size option, see the linker description chapter in the <i>ARM Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i>.</p>
                                    <p>At system initialization, SP is set to a designated address for the top of the stack. This address is the first location past the end of the .stack section. Since the position of the stack depends on where the .stack section is allocated, the actual address of the stack is determined at link time. </p>
                                    <p> The C/C++ environment automatically decrements SP at the entry to a function to reserve all the space necessary for the execution of that function. The stack pointer is incremented at the exit of the function to restore the stack to the state before the function was entered. If you interface assembly language routines to C/C++ programs, be sure to restore the stack pointer to the same state it was in before the function was entered. </p>
                                    <p>For more information about using the stack pointer, see <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0543031">Section 6.3</a></span>; for more information about the stack, see <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0545494">Section 6.4</a></span>.</p>

                                        <p>The compiler provides no means to check for stack overflow during compilation or at run time. A stack overflow disrupts the run-time environment, causing your program to fail. Be sure to allow enough space for the stack to grow. You can use the --entry_hook option to add code to the beginning of each function to check for stack overflow; see <span class="crossreference"><a href="using-the-c-c-compiler.html#STDZ0589656">Section 2.15</a></span>.</p>

                                        <span class="section-label">6.1.3 </span>Dynamic Memory Allocation</h4>
                                    <p>The run-time-support library supplied with the <span>ARM</span> compiler contains several functions (such as malloc, calloc, and realloc) that allow you to allocate memory dynamically for variables at run time. </p>
                                    <p>Memory is allocated from a global pool, or heap, that is defined in the <span>.sysmem</span> section. You can set the size of the <span>.sysmem</span> section by using the --heap_size=<i>size</i> option with the linker command. The linker also creates a global symbol, <span>__SYSMEM_SIZE</span>, and assigns it a value equal to the size of the heap in <span>bytes. </span>The default size is <span>2048 bytes.</span> For more information on the --heap_size option, see the linker description chapter in the <i> <span>ARM </span>Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i>.</p>
                                    <p>If you use any C I/O function, the RTS library allocates an I/O buffer for each file you access. This buffer will be a bit larger than BUFSIZ, which is defined in stdio.h and defaults to 256. Make sure you allocate a heap large enough for these buffers or use setvbuf to change the buffer to a statically-allocated buffer.</p>
                                    <p>Dynamically allocated objects are not addressed directly (they are always accessed with pointers) and the memory pool is in a separate section (<span>.sysmem</span>); therefore, the dynamic memory pool can have a size limited only by the amount of available memory in your system. To conserve space in the <span>.bss</span> section, you can allocate large arrays from the heap instead of defining them as global or static. For example, instead of a definition such as:</p>
                                    <code>struct big table[100];</code>
                                    <p>Use a pointer and call the malloc function:</p>
                                    <code>struct big *table
table = (struct big *)malloc(100*sizeof(struct big));</code>
                                    <p>When allocating from a heap, make sure the size of the heap is large enough for the allocation. This is particularly important when allocating variable-length arrays. </p>

                                        <p> The int, unsigned int, float, long and unsigned long data types are stored in memory as 32-bit objects at word (4 byte) aligned addresses. Objects of these types are loaded to and stored from bits 0-31 of a register, as shown in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0544741">Figure 6-2</a></span>. In big-endian mode, 4-byte objects are loaded to registers by moving the first byte (that is, the lower address) of memory to bits 24-31 of the register, moving the second byte of memory to bits 16-23, moving the third byte to bits 8-15, and moving the fourth byte to bits 0-7. In little-endian mode, 4-byte objects are loaded to registers by moving the first byte (that is, the lower address) of memory to bits 0-7 of the register, moving the second byte to bits 8-15, moving the third byte to bits 16-23, and moving the fourth byte to bits 24-31. </p>

                                        <p> Double, long double, long long and unsigned long long data types are stored in memory in a pair of registers and are always referenced as a pair. These types are stored as 64-bit objects at word (4 byte) aligned addresses. For FPA mode, the word at the lowest address contains the sign bit, the exponent, and the most significant part of the mantissa. The word at the higher address contains the least significant part of the mantissa. This is true regardless of the endianness of the target. For VFP mode, the words are ordered based upon the endianness of the target.</p>
                                        <p>Objects of this type are loaded into and stored in register pairs, as shown in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#SPNU1516650">Figure 6-3</a></span>. The most significant memory word contains the sign bit, exponent, and the most significant part of the mantissa. The least significant memory word contains the least significant part of the mantissa. </p>

 };</code>
                                        <p>The parameter d is the offset to be added to the beginning of the class object for this pointer. The parameter I is the index into the virtual function table, offset by 1. The index enables the NULL pointer to be represented. Its value is -1 if the function is non-virtual. The parameter f is the pointer to the member function if it is non-virtual, when I is 0. The 0 is the offset to the virtual function pointer within the class object.</p>

                                        <p>Structures are aligned according to the member with the most restrictive alignment requirement. Structures are padded so that the size of the structure is a multiple of its alignment. Arrays are always word aligned.

                                    <p>Bit fields are the only objects that are packed within a byte. That is, two bit fields can be stored in the same byte. Bit fields can range in size from 1 to 32 bits, but they never span a 4-byte boundary. </p>
                                    <p>For big-endian mode, bit fields are packed into registers from most significant bit (MSB) to least significant bit (LSB) in the order in which they are defined. Bit fields are packed in memory from most significant byte (MSbyte) to least significant byte (LSbyte). For little-endian mode, bit fields are packed into registers from the LSB to the MSB in the order in which they are defined, and packed in memory from LSbyte to MSbyte.</p>
                                    <p>Here are some details about how bit fields are handled:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">Plain int bit fields are unsigned. Consider the following C code: </li>
                                        <code>struct st
{
 int a:5;
} S;

foo()
{
 if (S.a &lt; 0)
 bar();
}</code>
                                        <p>In this example, bar () is never called as bit field 'a' is unsigned. Use signed int if you need a signed bit field.</p>
                                        <li value="2">Bit fields of type long long are supported.</li>
                                        <li value="3">Bit fields are treated as the declared type.</li>
                                        <li value="4">The size and alignment of the struct containing the bit field depends on the declared type of the bit field. For example, consider the struct: </li>
                                        <code>struct st {int a:4};</code>
                                        <p>This struct uses up 4 bytes and is aligned at 4 bytes.</p>
                                        <li value="5">Unnamed bit fields affect the alignment of the struct or union. For example, consider the struct: </li>
                                        <code>struct st{char a:4; int :22;};</code>
                                        <p>This struct uses 4 bytes and is aligned at a 4-byte boundary.</p>
                                        <li value="6">Bit fields declared volatile are accessed according to the bit field's declared type. A volatile bit field reference generates exactly one reference to its storage; multiple volatile bit field accesses are not merged.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        <span class="crossreference">
                                            <a href="#STDZ0545433">Figure 6-4</a>
                                        </span> illustrates bit-field packing, using the following bit field definitions:</p>
                                    <code>struct{
	int A:7
	int B:10
	int C:3
	int D:2
	int E:9
}x;</code>
                                    <p>A0 represents the least significant bit of the field A; A1 represents the next least significant bit, etc. Again, storage of bit fields in memory is done with a byte-by-byte, rather than bit-by-bit, transfer.</p>

                                        <span class="section-label">6.2.3 </span>Character String Constants</h4>
                                    <p>In C, a character string constant is used in one of the following ways:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">To initialize an array of characters. For example:</li>
                                        <code>   char s[] = "abc";</code>
                                        <p>When a string is used as an initializer, it is simply treated as an initialized array; each character is a separate initializer. For more information about initialization, see <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0543503">Section 6.10</a></span>.</p>
                                        <li value="2">In an expression. For example:</li>
                                        <code>   strcpy (s, "abc");</code>
                                        <p>When a string is used in an expression, the string itself is defined in the .const section with the .string assembler directive, along with a unique label that points to the string; the terminating 0 byte is included. For example, the following lines define the string abc, and the terminating 0 byte (the label SL5 points to the string):</p>
                                        <code>        .sect ".const" SL5: .string "abc",0</code>
                                        <p>String labels have the form SL<i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is a number assigned by the compiler to make the label unique. The number begins at 0 and is increased by 1 for each string defined. All strings used in a source module are defined at the end of the compiled assembly language module.</p>
                                        <p>The label SL<i>n</i> represents the address of the string constant. The compiler uses this label to reference the string expression.</p>
                                        <p>Because strings are stored in the .const section (possibly in ROM) and shared, it is bad practice for a program to modify a string constant. The following code is an example of incorrect string use:</p>
                                        <code>   const char *a = "abc" a[1] = 'x'; /* Incorrect! undefined behavior */</code>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                    <span class="section-label">6.3 </span>Register Conventions</h3>
                                <p>Strict conventions associate specific registers with specific operations in the C/C++ environment. If you plan to interface an assembly language routine to a C/C++ program, you must understand and follow these register conventions.</p>
                                <p>The register conventions dictate how the compiler uses registers and how values are preserved across function calls. <span class="crossreference"><a href="#SPNU1517836">Table 6-3</a></span> shows the types of registers affected by these conventions.<span class="crossreference"><a href="#IDregisterusage470">Table 6-4</a></span> summarizes how the compiler uses registers and whether their values are preserved across calls. For information about how values are preserved across calls, see <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0545494">Section 6.4</a></span>.</p>

                                <p>The C/C++ compiler imposes a strict set of rules on function calls. Except for special run-time support functions, any function that calls or is called by a C/C++ function must follow these rules. Failure to adhere to these rules can disrupt the C/C++ environment and cause a program to fail.</p>
                                <p>The following sections use this terminology to describe the function-calling conventions of the C/C++ compiler:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">
                                        <b>Argument block</b>. The part of the local frame used to pass arguments to other functions. Arguments are passed to a function by moving them into the argument block rather than pushing them on the stack. The local frame and argument block are allocated at the same time. </li>
                                    <li value="2">
                                        <b>Register save area</b>. The part of the local frame that is used to save the registers when the program calls the function and restore them when the program exits the function.</li>
                                    <li value="3">
                                        <b>Save-on-call registers</b>. Registers R0-R3 and R12 (alternate names are A1-A4 and V9). The called function does not preserve the values in these registers; therefore, the calling function must save them if their values need to be preserved.</li>
                                    <li value="4">
                                        <b>Save-on-entry registers</b>. Registers R4-R11 and R14 (alternate names are V1 to V8 and LR). It is the called function's responsibility to preserve the values in these registers. If the called function modifies these registers, it saves them when it gains control and preserves them when it returns control to the calling function.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>For details on the calling conventions in EABI mode or when using a VFP coprocessor, refer to the EABI documentation located in the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.subset.swdev.abi/index.html" target="_blank">ARM Information Center</a>.</p>

                                    </span> illustrates a typical function call. In this example, arguments are passed to the function, and the function uses local variables and calls another function. The first four arguments are passed to registers R0-R3. This example also shows allocation of a local frame and argument block for the called function. Functions that have no local variables and do not require an argument block do not allocate a local frame.</p>

                                        <li value="1">The calling function (parent) is responsible for preserving any save-on-call registers across the call that are live across the call. (The save-on-call registers are R0-R3 and R12 (alternate names are A1-A4 and V9).) </li>
                                        <li id="STDZ0548898" value="2">If the called function (child) returns a structure, the caller allocates space for the structure and passes the address of that space to the called function as the first argument.</li>
                                        <li value="3">The caller places the first arguments in registers R0-R3, in that order. The caller moves the remaining arguments to the argument block in reverse order, placing the leftmost remaining argument at the lowest address. Thus, the leftmost remaining argument is placed at the top of the stack.</li>
                                        <li value="4">If arguments were stored onto the argument block in step 3, the caller reserves a word in the argument block for dual-state support. (See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#SPNU1517263">Section 6.11</a></span> for more information.)</li>

The called function pushes these arguments on the stack if they meet both of these criteria:<ul><li value="1">The argument includes or follows the last explicitly declared argument.</li><li value="2">The argument is passed in a register.</li></ul></li>
                                        <li id="STDZ05495721" value="2">The called function pushes register values of all the registers that are modified by the function and that must be preserved upon exit of the function onto the stack. Normally, these registers are the save-on-entry registers (R4-R11 and R14 (alternate names are V1 to V8 and LR)) and the link register (R14) if the function contains calls. If the function is an interrupt, additional registers may need to be preserved. For more information, see <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0541002">Section 6.7</a></span>.</li>
                                        <li id="STDZ054831" value="3">The called function allocates memory for the local variables and argument block by subtracting a constant from the SP. This constant is computed with the following formula:</li>
                                        <p>
                                            <i>size of all local variables</i> + <i>max</i> = <i>constant</i></p>
                                        <p>The <i>max</i> argument specifies the size of all parameters placed in the argument block for each call.</p>
                                        <li value="4">The called function executes the code for the function.</li>
                                        <li value="5">If the called function returns a value, it places the value in R0 (or R0 and R1 values).</li>
                                        <li value="6">If the called function returns a structure, it copies the structure to the memory block that the first argument, R0, points to. If the caller does not use the return value, R0 is set to 0. This directs the called function not to copy the return structure. </li>
                                        <p>In this way, the caller can be smart about telling the called function where to return the structure. For example, in the statement s = f(x), where s is a structure and f is a function that returns a structure, the caller can simply pass the address of s as the first argument and call f. The function f then copies the return structure directly into s, performing the assignment automatically.</p>
                                        <p>You must be careful to properly declare functions that return structures, both at the point where they are called (so the caller properly sets up the first argument) and at the point where they are declared (so the function knows to copy the result).</p>
                                        <li value="7">The called function deallocates the frame and argument block by adding the constant computed in Step 3.</li>
                                        <li value="8">The called function restores all registers that were saved in Step 2.</li>
                                        <li value="9">The called function ( _f) loads the program counter (PC) with the return address.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>The following example is typical of how a called function responds to a call:</p>
                                    <code>                                 ; called function entry point
 STMFD SP!, {V1, V2, V3, LR} ; save V1, V2, V3, and LR
 SUB SP, SP, #16 ; allocate frame
 ... ; body of the function
 ADD SP, SP, #16 ; deallocate frame
 LDMFD SP!, {V1, V2, V3, PC} ; restore V1, V2, V3, and store LR
 ; in the PC, causing a return</code>

                                    <p>A function accesses its local nonregister variables indirectly through the stack pointer (SP or R13) and its stack arguments indirectly through the argument pointer (AP). If all stack arguments can be referenced with the SP, they are, and the AP is not reserved. The SP always points to the top of the stack (the most recently pushed value) and the AP points to the leftmost stack argument (the one closest to the top of the stack). For example:</p>
                                    <code>   LDR A2 [SP, #4] ; load local var from stack
 LDR A1 [AP, #0] ; load argument from stack</code>
                                    <p>Since the stack grows toward smaller addresses, the local and argument data on the stack for the C/C++ function is accessed with a positive offset from the SP or the AP register.</p>

                                    <p>Interfacing C/C++ with assembly language functions is straightforward if you follow the calling conventions defined in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0545494">Section 6.4</a></span>, and the register conventions defined in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0543031">Section 6.3</a></span>. C/C++ code can access variables and call functions defined in assembly language, and assembly code can access C/C++ variables and call C/C++ functions. </p>
                                    <p>Follow these guidelines to interface assembly language and C:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">You must preserve any dedicated registers modified by a function. Dedicated registers include:<ul><li value="1">Save-on-entry registers (R4-R11 (alternate names are V1 to V8 and LR))</li><li value="2">Stack pointer (SP or R13)</li></ul></li>
                                        <p>If the SP is used normally, it does not need to be explicitly preserved. In other words, the assembly function is free to use the stack as long as anything that is pushed onto the stack is popped back off before the function returns (thus preserving SP). </p>
                                        <p>Any register that is not dedicated can be used freely without first being saved.</p>
                                        <li value="2">Interrupt routines must save <i>all</i> the registers they use. For more information, see <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0541002">Section 6.7</a></span>.</li>
                                        <li value="3">When you call a C/C++ function from assembly language, load the designated registers with arguments and push the remaining arguments onto the stack as described in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0547291">Section 6.4.1</a></span>.</li>
                                        <p>Remember that a function can alter any register not designated as being preserved without having to restore it. If the contents of any of these registers must be preserved across the call, you must explicitly save them.</p>
                                        <li value="4">Functions must return values correctly according to their C/C++ declarations. Double values are returned in R0 and R1, and structures are returned as described in Step 2 of <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0547291">Section 6.4.1</a></span>. Any other values are returned in R0.</li>
                                        <li value="5">No assembly module should use the .cinit section for any purpose other than autoinitialization of global variables. The C/C++ startup routine assumes that the .cinit section consists <i>entirely</i> of initialization tables. Disrupting the tables by putting other information in .cinit can cause unpredictable results. </li>
                                        <li value="6">The compiler assigns linknames to all external objects. Thus, when you write assembly language code, you must use the same linknames as those assigned by the compiler. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="arm-c-c-language-implementation.html#STDZ0553675">Section 5.14</a></span> for details.</li>
                                        <li value="7">Any object or function declared in assembly language that is accessed or called from C/C++ must be declared with the .def or .global directive in the assembly language modifier. This declares the symbol as external and allows the linker to resolve references to it.</li>
                                        <p>Likewise, to access a C/C++ function or object from assembly language, declare the C/C++ object with the .ref or .global directive in the assembly language module. This creates an undeclared external reference that the linker resolves.</p>
                                    </ul>

                                        <p>You can define global constants in assembly language by using the .set directive in combination with either the .def or .global directive, or you can define them in a linker command file using a linker assignment statement. These constants are accessible from C/C++ only with the use of special operators.</p>
                                        <p>For <b>variables</b> defined in C/C++ or assembly language, the symbol table contains the <i>address of the value</i> contained by the variable. When you access an assembly variable by name from C/C++, the compiler gets the value using the address in the symbol table.</p>
                                        <p>For <b>assembly constants</b>, however, the symbol table contains the actual <i>value</i> of the constant. The compiler cannot tell which items in the symbol table are addresses and which are values. If you access an assembly (or linker) constant by name, the compiler tries to use the value in the symbol table as an address to fetch a value. To prevent this behavior, you must use the &amp; (address of) operator to get the value (_symval). In other words, if x is an assembly language constant, its value in C/C++ is &amp;x. See the section on "Using Linker Symbols in C/C++ Applications" in the <i><span>ARM</span> Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i> for more examples that use _symval.</p>
                                        <p>For more about symbols and the symbol table, refer to the section on "Symbols" in the <i><span>ARM</span> Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i>.</p>

                                    <p>Within a C/C++ program, you can use the asm statement to insert a single line of assembly language into the assembly language file created by the compiler.

                                <p>As long as you follow the guidelines in this section, you can interrupt and return to C/C++ code without disrupting the C/C++ environment. When the C/C++ environment is initialized, the startup routine does not enable or disable interrupts. If the system is initialized by way of a hardware reset, interrupts are disabled. If your system uses interrupts, you must handle any required enabling or masking of interrupts. Such operations have no effect on the C/C++ environment and are easily incorporated with asm statements or calling an assembly language function.</p>

Like all assembly functions, interrupt routines can use the stack, access global C/C++ variables, and call C/C++ functions normally. When calling C/C++ functions, be sure that any save-on-call registers are preserved before the call because the C/C++ function can modify any of these registers.

                                    <p> To map Cortex-A interrupt routines to interrupt vectors you need to include a intvecs.asm file. This file will contain assembly language directives that can be used to set up the ARM's interrupt vectors with branches to your interrupt routines. Follow these steps to use this file:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li value="1">Using <span class="crossreference"><a href="#SPNU1518305">Example 6-7</a></span> as a guide, create intvecs.asm and include your interrupt routines. For each routine:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li value="1">At the beginning of the file, add a .global directive that names the routine.</li><li value="2">Modify the appropriate .word directive to create a branch to the name of your routine. </li></ol></li>
                                        <li value="2">Assemble and link intvecs.asm with your applications code and with the compiler's linker control file (lnk16.cmd or lnk32.cmd). The control file contains a SECTIONS directive that maps the .intvecs section into the memory locations 0x00-0x1F. </li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <p>For example, on an ARM v4 target, if you have written a C interrupt routine for the IRQ interrupt called c_intIRQ and an assembly language routine for the FIQ interrupt called tim1_int, you should create intvecs.asm as in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#SPNU1518305">Example 6-7</a></span>.</p>

                                        <span class="section-label">6.7.5 </span>Using Software Interrupts</h4>
                                    <p> A software interrupt (SWI) is a synchronous exception generated by the execution of a particular instruction. Applications use software interrupts to request services from a protected system, such as an operating system, which can perform the services only while in a supervisor mode. Some ARM documentation uses the term Supervisor Calls (SVC) instead of "software interrupt".</p>
                                    <p>A C/C++ application can invoke a software interrupt by associating a software interrupt number with a function name through use of the SWI_ALIAS pragma and then calling the software interrupt as if it were a function. For information, see <span class="crossreference"><a href="arm-c-c-language-implementation.html#SPNU1513554">Section 5.10.25</a></span>.</p>
                                    <p>Since a call to the software interrupt function represents an invocation of the software interrupt, passing and returning data to and from a software interrupt is specified as normal function parameter passing with the following restriction:</p>
                                    <p>All arguments passed to a software interrupt must reside in the four argument registers (R0-R3). No arguments can be passed by way of a software stack. Thus, only four arguments can be passed unless:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">Floating-point doubles are passed, in which case each double occupies two registers.</li>
                                        <li value="2">Structures are returned, in which case the address of the returned structure occupies the first argument register.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>For Cortex-M architectures, C SWI handlers cannot return values. Values may be returned by SWI handlers on other architectures.</p>
                                    <p>The C/C++ compiler also treats the register usage of a called software interrupt the same as a called function. It assumes that all save-on-entry registers () are preserved by the software interrupt and that save-on-call registers (the remainder of the registers) can be altered by the software interrupt.</p>

                                        <span class="section-label">6.7.6 </span>Other Interrupt Information</h4>
                                    <p>An interrupt routine can perform any task performed by any other function, including accessing global variables, allocating local variables, and calling other functions.</p>
                                    <p>When you write interrupt routines, keep the following points in mind:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">It is your responsibility to handle any special masking of interrupts.</li>
                                        <li value="2">A C/C++ interrupt routine cannot be called directly from C/C++ code.</li>
                                        <li value="3">In a system reset interrupt, such as c_int00, you cannot assume that the run-time environment is set up; therefore, you <i>cannot allocate local variables</i>, and you <i>cannot save any information on the run-time stack</i>.</li>
                                        <li value="4"> In assembly language, remember to precede the name of a C/C++ interrupt with the appropriate linkname. For example, refer to c_int00 as _c_int00. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">When an interrupt occurs, the state of the processor (ARM or Thumb mode) is dependent on the device you are using. The compiler allows interrupt handlers to be defined in ARM or Thumb-2 mode. You should ensure the interrupt handler uses the proper mode for the device.</li>
                                        <li value="2">The FIQ, supervisor, abort, IRQ, and undefined modes have separate stacks that are not automatically set up by the C/C++ run-time environment. If you have interrupt routines in one of these modes, you must set up the software stack for that mode. However, ARM Cortex-M processors have two stacks, and the main stack (MSP), which is used by IRQ (the only interrupt type for Cortex-M), is automatically handled by the compiler. </li>
                                        <li value="3">Interrupt routines are not reentrant. If an interrupt routine enables interrupts of its type, it must save a copy of the return address and SPSR (the saved program status register) before doing so.</li>
                                        <li value="4">Because a software interrupt is synchronous, the register saving conventions discussed in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0541792">Section 6.7.1</a></span> can be less restrictive as long as the system is designed for this. A software interrupt routine generated by the compiler, however, follows the conventions in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0541792">Section 6.7.1</a></span>.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                <p> The intrinsic run-time-support library contains a number of assembly language routines that provide arithmetic and conversion capability for C/C++ operations that the 32-bit and 16-bit instruction sets do not provide. These routines include integer division, integer modulus, and floating-point operations.</p>
                                <p>There are two versions of each of the routines:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">A 16-bit version to be called only from the 16-BIS (bit instruction set) state</li>
                                    <li value="2">A 32-bit version only to be called from the 32-BIS state</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>These routines do not follow the standard C/C++ calling conventions in that the naming and register conventions are not upheld.

                                <p>Before you can run a C/C++ program, you must create the C/C++ run-time environment. The C/C++ boot routine performs this task using a function called <span>c_int00 (or _c_int00)</span>. The run-time-support source library, rts.src, contains the source to this routine in a module named boot.c (or boot.asm).</p>
                                <p>To begin running the system, the <span>c_int00</span> function can be <span>called by reset hardware.</span> You must link the <span>c_int00</span> function with the other object files. This occurs automatically when you use the --rom_model or --ram_model link option and include a standard run-time-support library as one of the linker input files.</p>
                                <p>When C/C++ programs are linked, the linker sets the entry point value in the executable output file to the symbol <span>c_int00</span>.</p>
                                <p>The <span>c_int00</span> function performs the following tasks to initialize the environment:</p>

                                    <p>Boot hooks are points at which you may insert application functions into the C/C++ boot process. Default boot hook functions are provided with the run-time support (RTS) library. However, you can implement customized versions of these boot hook functions, which override the default boot hook functions in the RTS library if they are linked before the run-time library. Such functions can perform any application-specific initialization before continuing with the C/C++ environment setup. </p>
                                    <p>Note that the TI-RTOS operating system uses custom versions of the boot hook functions for system setup, so you should be careful about overriding these functions if you are using TI-RTOS.</p>

                                    <p>
                                        <b>_system_pre_init():</b> This function provides a place to perform application-specific initialization. It is invoked after the stack pointer is initialized but before any C/C++ environment setup is performed. <span>For targets that include MPU support, this function is called after __mpu_init(). </span>By default, _system_pre_init() should return a non-zero value. The default C/C++ environment setup is bypassed if _system_pre_init() returns 0. </p>
                                    <p>
                                        <b>_system_post_cinit():</b> This function is invoked during C/C++ environment setup, after C/C++ global data is initialized but before any C++ constructors are called. This function should not return a value.</p>
                                    <p>The _c_int00( ) initialization routine also provides a mechanism for an application to perform the setup (set I/O registers, enable/disable timers, etc.) before the C/C++ environment is initialized.</p>

                                    <p>The run-time stack is allocated in a single continuous block of memory and grows down from high addresses to lower addresses. The SP points to the top of the stack. </p>
                                    <p>The code does not check to see if the run-time stack overflows. Stack overflow occurs when the stack grows beyond the limits of the memory space that was allocated for it. Be sure to allocate adequate memory for the stack.</p>
                                    <p>The stack size can be changed at link time by using the --stack_size link option on the linker command line and specifying the stack size as a constant directly after the option.</p>
                                    <p>The C/C++ boot routine shipped with the compiler sets up the user/thread mode run-time stack. If your program uses a run-time stack when it is in other operating modes, you must also allocate space and set up the run-time stack corresponding to those modes.</p>
                                    <p>EABI requires that 64-bit data (type long long and long double) be aligned at 64-bits. This requires that the stack be aligned at a 64-bit boundary at function entry so that local 64-bit variables are allocated in the stack with correct alignment. The boot routine aligns the stack at a 64-bit boundary. </p>

                                        <code>int i = 23;
int a[5] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };</code>
                                        <p>The compiler allocates the variables 'i' and 'a[] to .data section and the initial values are placed directly. </p>
                                        <code>        .global i
 .data
 .align 4
i:
 .field 23,32 ; i @ 0

 .global a
 .data
 .align 4
a:
 .field 1,32 ; a[0] @ 0
 .field 2,32 ; a[1] @ 32
 .field 3,32 ; a[2] @ 64
 .field 4,32 ; a[3] @ 96
 .field 5,32 ; a[4] @ 128</code>
                                        <p>Each compiled module that defines static or global variables contains these .data sections. The linker treats the .data section like any other initialized section and creates an output section. In the load-time initialization model, the sections are loaded into memory and used by the program. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0546592">Section 6.10.3.5</a></span>.</p>
                                        <p>In the run-time initialization model, the linker uses the data in these sections to create initialization data and an additional compressed initialization table. The boot routine processes the initialization table to copy data from load addresses to run addresses. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ054428">Section 6.10.3.3</a></span>.</p>

                                <p> The ARM is a unique processor in that it gives you the performance of a 32-bit architecture with the code density of a 16-bit architecture. It supports a 16-bit instruction set and a 32-bit instruction set that allows switching dynamically between the two sets.</p>
                                <p>The instruction set that the ARM processor uses is determined by the state of the processor. The processor can be in 32-BIS (bit instruction set) state or 16-BIS state at any given time. The compiler allows you to specify whether a module should be compiled in 32- or 16-BIS state and allows functions compiled in one state to call functions compiled in the other state.</p>

                                    <p>By default, the compiler allows dual-state interworking between functions. However, the compiler allows you to alter the level of support to meet your particular needs. </p>
                                    <p>In dual-state interworking, it is the called function's responsibility to handle the proper state changes required by the calling function. It is the calling function's responsibility to handle the proper state changes required to indirectly call a function (call it by address). Therefore, a function supports dual-state interworking if it provides the capability for functions requiring a state change to directly call the function (call it by name) and provides the mechanism to indirectly call functions involving state changes.</p>
                                    <p>If a function does not support dual-state interworking, it cannot be called by functions requiring a state change and cannot indirectly call functions that support dual-state interworking. Regardless of whether a function supports dual-state interworking or not, it can directly or indirectly call certain functions: </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">Directly call a function in the same state</li>
                                        <li value="2">Directly call a function in a different state if that function supports dual-state interworking</li>
                                        <li value="3">Indirectly call a function in the same state if that function does not support dual-state interworking</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Given this definition of dual-state support, the ARM C/C++ compiler offers three levels of support. Use <span class="crossreference"><a href="#SPNU1519058">Table 6-8</a></span> to determine the best level of support to use for your code.</p>

                                    <p>Here is detailed information about each level of support:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">
                                            <b>Default</b>. Full dual-state interworking is supported. For each function that supports full dual-state interworking, the compiler generates code that allows functions requiring a state change to call the function, whether it is ever used or not. This code is placed in a different section from the section the actual function is in. If the linker determines that this code is never referenced, it does not link it into the final executable image. However, the mechanism used with indirect calls to support dual-state interworking is integrated into the function and cannot be removed by the linker, even if the linker determines that the mechanism is not needed.</li>
                                        <li value="2">
                                            <b>Optimized</b>. Optimized dual-state interworking provides no additional functionality over the default level but optimizes the dual-state support code (in terms of code size and execution speed) for the case where a state change is required. It does this optimization by integrating the support into the function. Use the optimized level of support only when you know that a majority of the calls to this function require a state change. Even if the dual-state support code is never used, the linker cannot remove the code because it is integrated into the function. To specify this level of support, use the DUAL_STATE pragma. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="arm-c-c-language-implementation.html#SPNU1514307">Section 5.10.10</a></span> for more information.</li>
                                        <li value="3">
                                            <b>None</b>. Dual-state interworking is disabled. This level is invoked with the -md shell option. Functions with this support can directly call the following functions:<ul><li value="1">Functions compiled in the same state</li><li value="2">Functions in a different state that support dual-state interworking</li></ul></li>
                                        <p>Functions with this support level can indirectly call only functions that do not require a state change and do not support dual-state interworking. Because functions with this support level do not provide dual-state interworking, they cannot be called by a function requiring a state change.</p>
                                        <p>Use this support level if you do not require dual-state interworking, have frequent indirect calls, and cannot tolerate the additional code size or speed incurred by the indirect calls supporting dual-state interworking.</p>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>When a program does not require any state changes, the only difference between specifying no support and default support is that indirect calls are more complex in the default support level.</p>

                                    <p>Dual-state support is implemented by providing an alternate entry point for a function. This alternate entry point is used by functions requiring a state change. Dual-state support handles the change to the correct state and, if needed, changes the function back to the state of the caller when it returns. Also, indirect calls set up the return address so that once the called function returns, the state can be reliably changed back to that of the caller.</p>

                                        <p>The ARM compiler reserves the name space of all identifiers beginning with an underscore ( _ ) or a dollar sign ($). In this dual-state support scheme, all 32-BIS state entry points begin with an underscore, and all 16-BIS state entry points begin with a dollar sign. All other compiler-generated identifiers, which are independent of the state of the processor, begin with an underscore. By this convention, all direct calls within a 16-bit function refer to the entry point beginning with a dollar sign and all direct calls within a 32-bit function refer to the entry point beginning with an underscore.</p>
                                    </div>

                                        <p>Addresses of functions taken in 16-BIS state use the address of the 16-BIS state entry point to the function (with bit 0 of the address set). Likewise, addresses of functions taken in 32-BIS state use the address of the 32-BIS state entry point (with bit 0 of the address cleared). Then all indirect calls are performed by loading the address of the called function into a register and executing the branch and exchange (BX) instruction. This automatically changes the state and ensures that the code works correctly, regardless of what state the address was in when it was taken.</p>
                                        <p>The return address must also be set up so that the state of the processor is consistent and known upon return. Bit 0 of the address is tested to determine if the BX instruction invokes a state change. If it does not invoke a state change, the return address is set up for the state of the function. If it does invoke a change, the return address is set up for the alternate state and code is executed to return to the function's state.</p>
                                        <p>Because the entry point into a function depends upon the state of the function that takes the address, it is more efficient to take the address of a function when in the same state as that function. This ensures that the address of the actual function is used, not its alternate entry point. Because the indirect call can invoke a state change itself, entering a function through its alternate entry point, even if calling it from a different state, is unnecessary.</p>

                                        <p>Since sum( ) is a 16-bit function, its entry point is $sum. Because it was compiled for dual-state interworking, an alternate entry point, _sum, located in a different section is included. All calls to sum( ) requiring a state change use the _sum entry point.</p>
                                        <p>The call to max( ) in sum( ) references $max, because sum( ) is a 16-bit function. If max( ) were a 16-bit function, sum( ) would call the actual entry point for max( ). However, since max( ) is a 32-bit function, $max is the alternate entry point for max( ) and handles the state change required by sum( ).</p>
