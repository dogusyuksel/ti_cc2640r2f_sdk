                                <p>Texas Instruments Incorporated (‘TI”) technical, application or other design advice, services or information, including, but not limited to, reference designs and materials relating to evaluation modules, (collectively, “TI Resources”) are intended to assist designers who are developing applications that incorporate TI products; by downloading, accessing or using Resources in any way, you (individually or, if you are acting on behalf of a company, your company) agree to use it solely for this purpose and subject to the terms of this Notice.</p>
                                <p>TI’s provision of Resources does not expand or otherwise alter TI’s applicable published warranties or warranty disclaimers for TI products, and no additional obligations or liabilities arise from TI providing such Resources. TI reserves the right to make corrections, enhancements, improvements and other changes to its Resources.</p>
                                <p>You understand and agree that you remain responsible for using your independent analysis, evaluation and judgment in designing your applications and that you have full and exclusive responsibility to assure the safety of your applications and compliance of your applications (and of all TI products used in or for your applications) with all applicable regulations, laws and other applicable requirements. You represent that, with respect to your applications, you have all the necessary expertise to create and implement safeguards that (1) anticipate dangerous consequences of failures, (2) monitor failures and their consequences, and (3) lessen the likelihood of failures that might cause harm and take appropriate actions. You agree that prior to using or distributing any applications that include TI products, you will thoroughly test such applications and the functionality of such TI products as used in such applications. TI has not conducted any testing other than that specifically described in the published documentation for a particular Resource.</p>
                                <p>You are authorized to use, copy and modify any individual TI Resource only in connection with the development of applications that include the TI product(s) identified in such Resource.
