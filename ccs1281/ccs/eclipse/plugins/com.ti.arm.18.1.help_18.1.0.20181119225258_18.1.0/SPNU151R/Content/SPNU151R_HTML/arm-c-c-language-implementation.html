                                <p>The C compiler supports the 1989 <span>and 1999 </span>versions of the C language:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">
                                        <b>C89.</b> Compiling with the --c89 option causes the compiler to conform to the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 C standard, which was previously ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989. The names "C89" and "C90" refer to the same programming language. "C89" is used in this document.</li>
                                    <li value="2">
                                        <b>C99.</b> Compiling with the --c99 option causes the compiler to conform to the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 C standard. This standard supports several features not part of C89, such as inline functions, new data types, and one-line comments beginning with //.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The C language is also described in the second edition of Kernighan and Ritchie's <i>The C Programming Language</i> (K&amp;R). The compiler can also accept many of the language extensions found in the GNU C compiler (see <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0556475">Section 5.16</a></span>). </p>
                                <p>The compiler supports some features of C99 in the default relaxed ANSI mode with C89 support.<span> It supports all language features of C99 in C99 mode.</span> See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0552910">Section 5.15</a></span>.</p>
                                <p>In addition, the compiler supports many of the features described in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/compilers/arm-compiler-5/docs/101028/latest/1-preface" target="_blank">ARM C Language Extensions (ACLE) specification</a>. These features are applicable for the Cortex-M and Cortex-R processor variants. ACLE support affects the pre-defined macros (<span class="crossreference"><a href="using-the-c-c-compiler.html#t365166-1">Table 2-30</a></span>), function attributes (<span class="crossreference"><a href="#SPRU1878303">Section 5.16.2</a></span>), and intrinsics (<span class="crossreference"><a href="#SPNU1517034">Section 5.13</a></span>) you may use in C/C++ code. These features are implemented in order to support the development of source code that can be compiled using ACLE-compliant compilers from multiple vendors for a variety of ARM processors.</p>
                                <p>The ANSI/ISO standard identifies some features of the C language that may be affected by characteristics of the target processor, run-time environment, or host environment. This set of features can differ among standard compilers.</p>
                                <p>Unsupported features of the C library are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">The run-time library has minimal support for wide and multibyte characters. The type wchar_t is implemented as <span>unsigned short (16 bits), but can be an int if you set the --wchar_t=32 option</span>. The wide character set is equivalent to the set of values of type char. The library includes the header files &lt;wchar.h&gt; and &lt;wctype.h&gt;, but does not include all the functions specified in the standard.</li>
                                    <li value="2">The run-time library includes the header file &lt;locale.h&gt;, but with a minimal implementation. The only supported locale is the C locale. That is, library behavior that is specified to vary by locale is hard-coded to the behavior of the C locale, and attempting to install a different locale by way of a call to setlocale() will return NULL.</li>
                                    <li value="3">Some run-time functions and features in the C99 specification are not supported. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0552910">Section 5.15</a></span>.</li>

                                    <p>The C standard requires that conforming implementations provide documentation on how the compiler handles instances of implementation-defined behavior.</p>
                                    <p>The TI compiler officially supports a freestanding environment. The C standard does not require a freestanding environment to supply every C feature; in particular the library need not be complete. However, the TI compiler strives to provide most features of a hosted environment.</p>

It is the user's responsibility to make sure the access size is appropriate for devices that only tolerate accesses of certain widths. The TI compiler does not change the number of accesses to a volatile variable unless absolutely necessary. This is significant for read-modify-write expressions such as += ; for an architecture which does not have a corresponding read-modify-write instruction, the compiler will be forced to use two accesses, one for the read and one for the write. Even for architectures with such instructions, it is not guaranteed that the compiler will be able to map such expressions to an instruction with a single memory operand. It is not guaranteed that the memory system will lock that memory location for the duration of the instruction. In a multi-core system, some other core may write the location after a RMW instruction reads it, but before it writes the result. The TI compiler will not reorder two volatile accesses, but it may reorder a volatile and a non-volatile access, so volatile cannot be used to create a critical section. Use some sort of lock if you need to create a critical section. (6.7.3)</li>

                                <p>The <span>ARM</span> compiler supports C++ as defined in the ANSI/ISO/IEC 14882:2014 standard, including these features: </p>
                                <ul>

However, there is no low-level file I/O for wide chars. Also, the C library interface to wide char support (through the C++ headers &lt;cwchar&gt; and &lt;cwctype&gt;) is limited as described above in the C library.</li>

                                <p>MISRA C is a set of software development guidelines for the C programming language. It promotes best practices in developing safety-related electronic systems in road vehicles and other embedded systems. MISRA C was originally launched in 1998 by the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association, and has since been adopted across a wide variety of industries. A subsequent update to the guidelines was publishes as MISRA C:2004</p>
                                <p>You can alter your code to work with the MISRA C:2004 rules. The following options and pragmas can be used to enable/disable rules:</p>

                                    <li value="1">The --check_misra option enables checking of the specified MISRA C:2004 rules. This compiler option must be used if you want to enable further control over checking using the CHECK_MISRA and RESET_MISRA pragmas.</li>

                                    <p>For C++ and relaxed C89/C99, the compiler allows enumeration constants up to the largest integral type (<span>64 bits</span>). The default, which is recommended, is for the underlying type to be the first type in the following list in which all the enumerated constant values can be represented: <span>int, unsigned int, long, unsigned long long long, unsigned long long</span>.</p>

                                        <span class="section-label">5.6.1 </span>The const Keyword</h4>
                                    <p>The C/C++ compiler supports the ANSI/ISO standard keyword <i>const</i> in all modes.</p>
                                    <p>This keyword gives you greater optimization and control over allocation of storage for certain data objects. You can apply the const qualifier to the definition of any variable or array to ensure that its value is not altered.</p>
                                    <p>Global objects qualified as const are placed in the <span>.const</span> section. The linker allocates the <span>.const</span> section from ROM or FLASH, which are typically more plentiful than RAM. The const data storage allocation rule has the following exceptions:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">If <i>volatile</i> is also specified in the object definition. For example, <span class="code">volatile const int</span><span class="code">x</span>. Volatile keywords are assumed to be allocated to RAM. (The program is not allowed to modify a const volatile object, but something external to the program might.)</li>
                                        <li value="2">If the object has automatic storage (<span>function scope</span>).</li>
                                        <li id="t365168-32" value="3">If the object is a C++ object with a "mutable" member.</li>
                                        <li id="t365168-33" value="4"> If the object is initialized with a value that is not known at compile time (such as the value of another variable).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>In these cases, the storage for the object is the same as if the const keyword were not used.</p>
                                    <p>The placement of the const keyword within a definition is important. For example, the first statement below defines a constant pointer p to a modifiable int. The second statement defines a modifiable pointer q to a constant int:</p>
                                    <code>int * const p = &amp;x;
const int * q = &amp;x;</code>
                                    <p>Using the const keyword, you can define large constant tables and allocate them into system ROM. For example, to allocate a ROM table, you could use the following definition:</p>
                                    <code>const int digits[] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9};</code>

                                        <span class="section-label">5.6.2 </span>The __interrupt Keyword</h4>
                                    <p>The compiler extends the C/C++ language by adding the __interrupt keyword, which specifies that a function is treated as an interrupt function. This keyword is an IRQ interrupt. The alternate keyword, "interrupt", may also be used except in strict ANSI C or C++ modes.</p>
                                    <p>Note that the interrupt function attribute described in <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0556804">Section 5.10.15</a></span> is the recommended syntax for declaring interrupt functions.</p>
                                    <p>Functions that handle interrupts follow special register-saving rules and a special return sequence. The implementation stresses safety. The interrupt routine does not assume that the C run-time conventions for the various CPU register and status bits are in effect; instead, it re-establishes any values assumed by the run-time environment. When C/C++ code is interrupted, the interrupt routine must preserve the contents of all machine registers that are used by the routine or by any function called by the routine. When you use the __interrupt keyword with the definition of the function, the compiler generates register saves based on the rules for interrupt functions and the special return sequence for interrupts.</p>
                                    <p>You can only use the __interrupt keyword with a function that is defined to return void and that has no parameters. The body of the interrupt function can have local variables and is free to use the stack or global variables. For example:</p>
                                    <code>__interrupt void int_handler()
{
 unsigned int flags;
 ...
}</code>
                                    <p>The name c_int00 is the C/C++ entry point. This name is reserved for the system reset interrupt. This special interrupt routine initializes the system and calls the main() function. Because it has no caller, c_int00 does not save any registers.</p>

                                        <p class="note_title">NOTE</p>
                                        <b>Hwi Objects and the __interrupt Keyword</b>
                                        <p>The __interrupt keyword must not be used when SYS/BIOS Hwi objects are used in conjunction with C functions. The Hwi_enter/Hwi_exit macros and the Hwi dispatcher already contain this functionality, and the use of the C modifier can cause unwanted conflicts.</p>

                                        <span class="section-label">5.6.3 </span>The volatile Keyword</h4>
                                    <p>The C/C++ compiler supports the <i>volatile</i> keyword in all modes. In addition, the __volatile keyword is supported in relaxed ANSI mode for C89, C99, and C++.</p>
                                    <p>The volatile keyword indicates to the compiler that there is something about how the variable is accessed that requires that the compiler not use overly-clever optimization on expressions involving that variable. For example, the variable may also be accessed by an external program, <span>an interrupt, </span>another thread, or a peripheral device.</p>
                                    <p>The compiler eliminates redundant memory accesses whenever possible, using data flow analysis to figure out when it is legal. However, some memory accesses may be special in some way that the compiler cannot see, and in such cases you should use the volatile keyword to prevent the compiler from optimizing away something important. The compiler does not optimize out any accesses to variables declared volatile. The number of volatile reads and writes will be exactly as they appear in the C/C++ code, no more and no less and in the same order. </p>
                                    <p>Any variable which might be modified by something external to the obvious control flow of the program<span> (such as an interrupt service routine)</span> must be declared volatile. This tells the compiler that <span>an interrupt function</span> might modify the value at any time, so the compiler should not perform optimizations which will change the number or order of accesses of that variable. This is the primary purpose of the volatile keyword. In the following example, the loop intends to wait for a location to be read as 0xFF:</p>
                                    <code>   unsigned int *ctrl;
 while (*ctrl !=0xFF);</code>
                                    <p>However, in this example, *ctrl is a loop-invariant expression, so the loop is optimized down to a single-memory read. To get the desired result, define ctrl as:</p>
                                    <code>   volatile unsigned int *ctrl;</code>
                                    <p>Here the *ctrl pointer is intended to reference a hardware location<span>, such as an interrupt flag</span>.</p>
                                    <p>The volatile keyword must also be used when accessing memory locations that represent memory-mapped peripheral devices. Such memory locations might change value in ways that the compiler cannot predict. These locations might change if accessed, or when some other memory location is accessed, or when some signal occurs. </p>
                                    <p>Volatile must also be used for local variables in a function which calls setjmp, if the value of the local variables needs to remain valid if a longjmp occurs.</p>

                                <p>The compiler supports all the C++ exception handling features as defined by the ANSI/ISO 14882 C++ Standard. More details are discussed in <i>The C++ Programming Language, Third Edition</i> by Bjarne Stroustrup.</p>
                                <p>The compiler --exceptions option enables exception handling. The compiler’s default is no exception handling support.</p>
                                <p>For exceptions to work correctly, all C++ files in the application must be compiled with the --exceptions option, regardless of whether exceptions occur in a particular file.

                                <p>Exception handling requires support in the run-time-support library, which come in exception-enabled and exception-disabled forms; you must link with the correct form. When using automatic library selection (the default), the linker automatically selects the correct library <span class="crossreference"><a href="linking-c-c-code.html#STDZ0564809">Section 4.3.1.1</a></span>. If you select the library manually, you must use run-time-support libraries whose name contains _eh if you enable exceptions. </p>
                                <p>Using the --exceptions option causes the compiler to insert exception handling code.

                                <p>The C/C++ compiler allows the use of the keyword register on global and local register variables and parameters. This section describes the compiler implementation for this qualifier.</p>

                                    <p>The C/C++ compiler treats register variables (variables defined with the register keyword) differently, depending on whether you use the --opt_level (-O) option.</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">
                                            <b>Compiling with optimization</b>
                                        </li>
                                        <p>The compiler ignores any register definitions and allocates registers to variables and temporary values by using an algorithm that makes the most efficient use of registers.</p>
                                        <li value="2">
                                            <b>Compiling without optimization</b>
                                        </li>
                                        <p>If you use the register keyword, you can suggest variables as candidates for allocation into registers. The compiler uses the same set of registers for allocating temporary expression results as it uses for allocating register variables.</p>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The compiler attempts to honor all register definitions. If the compiler runs out of appropriate registers, it frees a register by moving its contents to memory. If you define too many objects as register variables, you limit the number of registers the compiler has for temporary expression results. This limit causes excessive movement of register contents to memory.</p>
                                    <p>Any object with a scalar type (integral, floating point, or pointer) can be defined as a register variable. The register designator is ignored for objects of other types, such as arrays.</p>
                                    <p>The register storage class is meaningful for parameters as well as local variables. Normally, in a function, some of the parameters are copied to a location on the stack where they are referenced during the function body. The compiler copies a register parameter to a register instead of the stack, which speeds access to the parameter within the function.</p>

                                    <p>The C/C++ compiler extends the C language by adding a special convention to the register storage class specifier to allow the allocation of global registers. This special global declaration has the form:</p>
                                    <div class="subsection">
                                        <table class="tabbedtext">

                                            </colgroup>
                                            <tbody>
                                                <tr>
                                                    <td> <b>register</b><i>type regid</i> <![CDATA[ ]]></td>
                                                </tr>
                                            </tbody>
                                        </table>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>The <i>regid</i> parameter can be __R5, __R6, or __R9. The identifiers _ _R5, _ _R6, and _ _R9 are each bound to their corresponding register R5, R6 and R9, respectively.</p>
                                    <p>When you use this declaration at the file level, the register is permanently reserved from any other use by the optimizer and code generator for that file. You cannot assign an initial value to the register. You can use a #define directive to assign a meaningful name to the register; for example:</p>
                                    <code>register struct data_struct *__R5
#define data_pointer __R5
data_pointer-&gt;element;
data_pointer++;</code>
                                    <p> There are two reasons that you would be likely to use a global register variable:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1"> You are using a global variable throughout your program, and it would significantly reduce code size and execution speed to assign this variable to a register permanently.</li>
                                        <li value="2"> You are using an interrupt service routine that is called so frequently that it would significantly reduce execution speed if the routine did not have to save and restore the register(s) it uses every time it is called.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>You need to consider very carefully the implications of reserving a global register variable. Registers are a precious resource to the compiler, and using this feature indiscriminately may result in poorer code.</p>
                                    <p>You also need to consider carefully how code with a globally declared register variable interacts with other code, including library functions, that does not recognize the restriction placed on the register.</p>
                                    <p> Because the registers that can be global register variables are save-on-entry registers, a normal function call and return does not affect the value in the register and neither does a normal interrupt. However, when you mix code that has a globally declared register variable with code that does not have the register reserved, it is still possible for the value in the register to become corrupted. To avoid the possibility of corruption, you must follow these rules:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1"> Functions that alter global register variables cannot be called by functions that are not aware of the global register. Use the -r shell option to reserve the register in code that is not aware of the global register declaration. You must be careful if you pass a pointer to a function as an argument. If the passed function alters the global register variable and the called function saves the register, the value in the register will be corrupted.</li>
                                        <li value="2"> You cannot access a global register variable in an interrupt service routine unless you recompile all code, including all libraries, to reserve the register. This is because the interrupt routine can be called from any point in the program.</li>
                                        <li value="3"> The longjmp ( ) function restores global register variables to the values they had at the setjmp ( ) location. If this presents a problem in your code, you must alter the code for the function and recompile rts.src.</li>
                                        <p> The -r <i>register</i> compiler command-line option allows you to prevent the compiler from using the named register. This lets you reserve the named register in modules that do not have the global register variable declaration, such as the run-time-support libraries, if you need to compile the modules to prevent some of the above occurrences.</p>
                                    </ul>

                                <p> The C/C++ compiler can embed assembly language instructions or directives directly into the assembly language output of the compiler. This capability is an extension to the C/C++ language implemented through the<i> __asm</i> keyword. The __asm keyword provides access to hardware features that C/C++ cannot provide. </p>
                                <p>The alternate keyword, "asm", may also be used except in strict ANSI C mode. It is available in relaxed C and C++ modes.</p>
                                <p>Using __asm is syntactically performed as a call to a function named __asm, with one string constant argument:</p>

                                <p>The compiler copies the argument string directly into your output file. The assembler text must be enclosed in double quotes. All the usual character string escape codes retain their definitions. For example, you can insert a .byte directive that contains quotes as follows:</p>
                                <code>__asm("STR: .byte \"abc\"");</code>
                                <p>The inserted code must be a legal assembly language statement. Like all assembly language statements, the line of code inside the quotes must begin with a label, a blank, a tab, or a comment (asterisk or semicolon). The compiler performs no checking on the string; if there is an error, the assembler detects it. For more information about the assembly language statements, see the <i><span>ARM</span> Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i>.</p>
                                <p>The __asm statements do not follow the syntactic restrictions of normal C/C++ statements. Each can appear as a statement or a declaration, even outside of blocks. This is useful for inserting directives at the very beginning of a compiled module.</p>
                                <p>The __asm statement does not provide any way to refer to local variables. If your assembly code needs to refer to local variables, you will need to write the entire function in assembly code.</p>

                                    <p>Be careful not to disrupt the C/C++ environment with __asm statements. The compiler does not check the inserted instructions. Inserting jumps and labels into C/C++ code can cause unpredictable results in variables manipulated in or around the inserted code. Directives that change sections or otherwise affect the assembly environment can also be troublesome.</p>
                                    <p>Be especially careful when you use optimization with __asm statements. Although the compiler cannot remove __asm statements, it can significantly rearrange the code order near them and cause undesired results.</p>

                                    <p>The CALLS pragma specifies a set of functions that can be called indirectly from a specified calling function. </p>
                                    <p>The CALLS pragma is used by the compiler to embed debug information about indirect calls in object files. Using the CALLS pragma on functions that make indirect calls enables such indirect calls to be included in calculations for such functions' inclusive stack sizes. For more information on generating function stack usage information, see the -cg option of the Object File Display Utility in the "Invoking the Object File Display Utility" section of the <i><span>ARM</span> Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i>.</p>
                                    <p>The CALLS pragma can precede either the calling function's definition or its declaration. In C, the pragma must have at least 2 arguments—the first argument is the calling function, followed by at least one function that will be indirectly called from the calling function. In C++, the pragma applies to the next function declared or defined, and the pragma must have at least one argument. </p>
                                    <p>The syntax for the CALLS pragma in C is as follows. This indicates that calling_function can indirectly call function_1 through function_n.</p>

                                    <p>The diagnostic affected (<i>num</i>) is specified using either an error number or an error tag name. The equal sign (=) is optional.

                                    <p> By default (that is, without the compiler -md option), all functions with external linkage support dual-state interworking. This support assumes that most calls do not require a state change and are therefore optimized (in terms of code size and execution speed) for calls not requiring a state change. Using the DUAL_STATE pragma does not change the functionality of the dual-state support, but it does assert that calls to the applied function often require a state change. Therefore, such support is optimized for state changes. </p>
                                    <p>The pragma must appear before any declaration or reference to the function that you want to keep. In C, the argument <i>func</i> is the name of the function. In C++, the pragma applies to the next function declared.</p>

                                    <p> The MUST_ITERATE pragma specifies to the compiler certain properties of a loop. When you use this pragma, you are guaranteeing to the compiler that a loop executes a specific number of times or a number of times within a specified range.</p>
                                    <p>Any time the UNROLL pragma is applied to a loop, MUST_ITERATE should be applied to the same loop. For loops the MUST_ITERATE pragma's third argument, multiple, is the most important and should always be specified.</p>
                                    <p>Furthermore, the MUST_ITERATE pragma should be applied to any other loops as often as possible. This is because the information provided via the pragma (especially the minimum number of iterations) aids the compiler in choosing the best loops and loop transformations (that is, nested loop transformations). It also helps the compiler reduce code size.</p>
                                    <p>No statements are allowed between the MUST_ITERATE pragma and the for, while, or do-while loop to which it applies. However, other pragmas, such as UNROLL, can appear between the MUST_ITERATE pragma and the loop.</p>

                                        <p>The arguments <i>min</i> and <i>max </i>are programmer-guaranteed minimum and maximum trip counts. The trip count is the number of times a loop iterates. The trip count of the loop must be evenly divisible by <i>multiple</i>. All arguments are optional. For example, if the trip count could be 5 or greater, you can specify the argument list as follows:</p>
                                        <code>#pragma MUST_ITERATE(5)</code>
                                        <p>However, if the trip count could be any nonzero multiple of 5, the pragma would look like this:</p>
                                        <code>#pragma MUST_ITERATE(5, , 5) /* Note the blank field for max */</code>
                                        <p>It is sometimes necessary for you to provide min and multiple in order for the compiler to perform unrolling. This is especially the case when the compiler cannot easily determine how many iterations the loop will perform (that is, the loop has a complex exit condition).</p>
                                        <p>When specifying a multiple via the MUST_ITERATE pragma, results of the program are undefined if the trip count is not evenly divisible by multiple. Also, results of the program are undefined if the trip count is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum specified.</p>
                                        <p>If no min is specified, zero is used. If no max is specified, the largest possible number is used. If multiple MUST_ITERATE pragmas are specified for the same loop, the smallest max and largest min are used.</p>

                                        <p>Through the use of the MUST_ITERATE pragma, you can guarantee that a loop executes a certain number of times. The example below tells the compiler that the loop is guaranteed to run exactly 10 times:</p>
                                        <code>#pragma MUST_ITERATE(10,10)

for(i = 0; i &lt; trip_count; i++) { ...</code>
                                        <p>In this example, the compiler attempts to generate a loop even without the pragma. However, if MUST_ITERATE is not specified for a loop such as this, the compiler generates code to bypass the loop, to account for the possibility of 0 iterations. With the pragma specification, the compiler knows that the loop iterates at least once and can eliminate the loop-bypassing code.</p>
                                        <p>MUST_ITERATE can specify a range for the trip count as well as a factor of the trip count. The following example tells the compiler that the loop executes between 8 and 48 times and the trip_count variable is a multiple of 8 (8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48). The multiple argument allows the compiler to unroll the loop.</p>
                                        <code>#pragma MUST_ITERATE(8, 48, 8)
for(i = 0; i &lt; trip_count; i++) { ...</code>
                                        <p>You should consider using MUST_ITERATE for loops with complicated bounds. In the following example, the compiler would have to generate a divide function call to determine, at run time, the number of iterations performed.</p>
                                        <code>for(i2 = ipos[2]; i2 &lt; 40; i2 += 5) { ...</code>
                                        <p>The compiler will not do the above. In this case, using MUST_ITERATE to specify that the loop always executes eight times allows the compiler to attempt to generate a loop:</p>
                                        <code>#pragma MUST_ITERATE(8, 8)

for(i2 = ipos[2]; i2 &lt; 40; i2 += 5) { ...</code>

                                    <p>Global and static variables are zero-initialized. However, in applications that use non-volatile memory, it may be desirable to have variables that are not initialized. Noinit variables are global or static variables that are not zero-initialized at startup or reset.</p>
                                    <p>Persistent and noinit variables behave identically with the exception of whether or not they are initialized at load time.</p>
                                    <p>The NOINIT pragma may be used in conjunction with the LOCATION pragma to map variables to special memory locations, like memory-mapped registers, without generating unwanted writes. The NOINIT pragma may only be used with uninitialized variables.</p>
                                    <p>The PERSISTENT pragma is similar to the NOINIT pragma, except that it may only be used with statically-initialized variables. Persistent variables disable startup initialization; they are given an initial value when the code is loaded, but are never again initialized.</p>

                                        <p class="note_title">NOTE</p>
                                        <p>When using these pragmas in non-volatile FRAM memory, the memory region could be protected against unintended writes through the device's Memory Protection Unit. Some devices have memory protection enabled by default. Please see the information about memory protection in the datasheet for your device. If the Memory Protection Unit is enabled, it first needs to be disabled before modifying the variables.</p>
                                    </span>
                                    <p>If you are using non-volatile RAM, you can define a persistent variable with an initial value of zero loaded into RAM. The program can increment that variable over time as a counter, and that count will not disappear if the device loses power and restarts, because the memory is non-volatile and the boot routines do not initialize it back to zero. For example:</p>
                                    <code>#pragma PERSISTENT(x)
#pragma location = 0xC200 // memory address in RAM
int x = 0; 

void main() {
 run_init();

 while (1) {
 run_actions(x); 
 __delay_cycles(1000000); 
 x++;
 }

                                    <p>If possible, the compiler unrolls the loop so there are <i>n </i>copies of the original loop. The compiler only unrolls if it can determine that unrolling by a factor of <i>n</i> is safe. In order to increase the chances the loop is unrolled, the compiler needs to know certain properties:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">The loop iterates a multiple of <i>n</i> times. This information can be specified to the compiler via the multiple argument in the MUST_ITERATE pragma.</li>
                                        <li value="2">The smallest possible number of iterations of the loop</li>
                                        <li value="3">The largest possible number of iterations of the loop</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>The compiler can sometimes obtain this information itself by analyzing the code. However, sometimes the compiler can be overly conservative in its assumptions and therefore generates more code than is necessary when unrolling. This can also lead to not unrolling at all. Furthermore, if the mechanism that determines when the loop should exit is complex, the compiler may not be able to determine these properties of the loop. In these cases, you must tell the compiler the properties of the loop by using the MUST_ITERATE pragma.</p>
                                    <p>Specifying #pragma UNROLL(1) asks that the loop not be unrolled. Automatic loop unrolling also is not performed in this case.</p>
                                    <p>If multiple UNROLL pragmas are specified for the same loop, it is undefined which pragma is used, if any.</p>

The symbol can be a data or function variable. In effect, unresolved weak <i>references</i> do not cause linker errors and do not have any effect at run time. The following apply for weak references:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li value="1">Libraries are not searched to resolve weak references. It is not an error for a weak reference to remain unresolved.</li>
                                        <li value="2">During linking, the value of an undefined weak reference is:<ul><li value="1">Zero if the relocation type is absolute</li><li value="2">The address of the place if the relocation type is PC-relative</li><li value="3">The address of the nominal base address if the relocation type is base-relative.</li></ul></li>

                                    <p>A weak <i>definition</i> does not change the rules by which object files are selected from libraries. However, if a link set contains both a weak definition and a non-weak definition, the non-weak definition is always used.</p>

                                <p>The <span>ARM</span> C/C++ compiler supports the C99 preprocessor _Pragma() operator. This preprocessor operator is similar to #pragma directives. However, _Pragma can be used in preprocessing macros (#defines).</p>
                                <p>The syntax of the operator is:</p>
                                <div class="subsection">

                                <p>The argument <i>string_literal</i> is interpreted in the same way the tokens following a #pragma directive are processed. The string_literal must be enclosed in quotes. A quotation mark that is part of the string_literal must be preceded by a backward slash.</p>
                                <p>You can use the _Pragma operator to express #pragma directives in macros. For example, the DATA_SECTION syntax:</p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>#pragma DATA_SECTION(</b>
                                    <i>func</i>
                                    <b>,"</b>
                                    <i>section</i>
                                    <b>")</b>
                                </p>
                                <p>Is represented by the _Pragma() operator syntax:</p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>_Pragma ("DATA_SECTION(</b>
                                    <i>func</i>
                                    <b>,\"</b>
                                    <i>section</i>

                                </p>
                                <p>The following code illustrates using _Pragma to specify the DATA_SECTION pragma in a macro:</p>
                                <code>...
#define EMIT_PRAGMA(x) _Pragma(#x)
#define COLLECT_DATA(var) EMIT_PRAGMA(DATA_SECTION(var,"mysection"))

COLLECT_DATA(x)
int x;
...</code>
                                <p>The EMIT_PRAGMA macro is needed to properly expand the quotes that are required to surround the section argument to the DATA_SECTION pragma.</p>

                                <p>An Application Binary Interface (ABI) defines how functions that are written separately and compiled or assembled separately can work together. This involves standardizing data type storage, register conventions, and function structure and calling conventions. It should define linkname generation from C symbols. It defines the object file format and the debug format. It should document how the system is initialized. In the case of C++ it defines C++ name mangling and exception handling support.</p>
                                <p>The COFF ABI is not supported in v15.6.0.STS and later versions of the TI Code Generation Tools. If you want to produce COFF output files, please use v5.2 of the ARM tools and see <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/spru151J" target="_blank">SPRU151J</a>.</p>
                                <p> The ARM ABIv2 has become an industry standard for the ARM architecture. It has these advantages:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">It enables interlinking of objects built with different tool chains. For example, this enables a library built with RVCT to be linked in with an application built with the ARM 4.6 toolset.</li>
                                    <li value="2">It is well documented. The complete ARM ABI specifications are in the <a href="http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.subset.swdev.abi/index.html" target="_blank">ARM Information Center</a>.</li>
                                    <li value="3">It is modern. EABI requires ELF object file format which enables supporting modern language features like early template instantiation and export inline functions support.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>ARM ABIv2 allows a vendor to define the system initialization in the bare-metal mode. TI-specific information on EABI mode is described in <span class="crossreference"><a href="run-time-environment.html#STDZ0549369">Section 6.10.3</a></span>. The __TI_EABI_ASSEMBLER predefined symbol is set to 1 if compiling for EABI.</p>

                                <p>In addition, the compiler supports many of the intrinsics described in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/compilers/arm-compiler-5/docs/101028/latest/1-preface" target="_blank">ARM C Language Extensions (ACLE) specification</a>. These intrinsics are applicable for the Cortex-M and Cortex-R processor variants. The ACLE intrinsics are implemented in order to support the development of source code that can be compiled using ACLE-compliant compilers from multiple vendors for a variety of ARM processors. A number of the intrinsics are duplicates of intrinsics listed in the previous table but with slightly different names (such as one vs. two leading underscores).</p>
                                <p>The compiler does not support all of the ACLE intrinsics listed in the ACLE specification. For example, the __cls, __clsl, and __clsll ACLE intrinsics are not supported, because the CLS instruction is not available on the Cortex-M or Cortex-R architectures.</p>
                                <p> In order to use the ACLE intrinsics, your code must include the provided <span class="code">arm_acle.h</span> header file. For details about the ACLE intrinsics, see the ACLE specification. For information about which ACLE intrinsics are supported, see the <span class="code">arm_acle.h</span> file. Where applicable, the declarations of ACLE intrinsics that are not supported are enclosed in comments in that header file along with a brief explanation of why the intrinsic is not supported and a reference to the appropriate section in the ACLE specification where the intrinsic is described.</p>

                                    <span class="section-label">5.14 </span>Object File Symbol Naming Conventions (Linknames)</h3>
                                <p>Each externally visible identifier is assigned a unique symbol name to be used in the object file, a so-called <i>linkname</i>. This name is assigned by the compiler according to an algorithm which depends on the name, type, and source language of the symbol. This algorithm may add a prefix to the identifier (typically an underscore), and it may <i>mangle</i> the name.</p>
                                <p>User-defined symbols in C code and in assembly code are in the same namespace, which means you are responsible for making sure that your C identifiers do not collide with your assembly code identifiers. You may have identifiers that collide with assembly keywords (for instance, register names); in this case, the compiler automatically uses an escape sequence to prevent the collision. The compiler escapes the identifier with double parallel bars, which instructs the assembler not to treat the identifier as a keyword. You are responsible for making sure that C identifiers do not collide with user-defined assembly code identifiers.</p>
                                <p>Name mangling encodes the types of the parameters of a function in the linkname for a function. Name mangling only occurs for C++ functions which are not declared 'extern "C"'. Mangling allows function overloading, operator overloading, and type-safe linking. Be aware that the return value of the function is not encoded in the mangled name, as C++ functions cannot be overloaded based on the return value. </p>
                                <p>For example, the general form of a C++ linkname for a <span>32-bit </span>function named func is:</p>
                                <p>
                                    <b>__func__F</b>

                                <p>Where parmcodes is a sequence of letters that encodes the parameter types of func.</p>
                                <p>For this simple C++ source file:</p>
                                <code>int foo(int I){ } //global C++ function compiled in 16-bit mode</code>
                                <p>This is the resulting assembly code:</p>
                                <code>$__foo__Fi</code>
                                <p>The linkname of foo is <span>$__foo__Fi</span>, indicating that foo is a <span>16-bit </span>function that takes a single argument of type int. To aid inspection and debugging, a name demangling utility is provided that demangles names into those found in the original C++ source. See <span class="crossreference"><a href="c-name-demangler.html#STDZ0516394">Section 8</a></span> for more information.</p>
                                <p>The mangling algorithm follows that described in the Itanium C++ ABI (<a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/abi.html" target="_blank">http://www.codesourcery.com/cxx-abi/abi.html</a>).</p>

                                <p>The language mode command-line options determine how the compiler interprets your source code. You specify one option to identify which language standard your code follows. You can also specify a separate option to specify how strictly the compiler should expect your code to conform to the standard.</p>
                                <p>Specify one of the following language options to control the language standard that the compiler expects the source to follow. The options are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">ANSI/ISO C89 (--c89, default for C files) </li>

                                </ul>
                                <p> Use one of the following options to specify how strictly the code conforms to the standard: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">Relaxed ANSI/ISO (--relaxed_ansi or -pr) This is the default. </li>

                                </ul>
                                <p>The default is relaxed ANSI/ISO mode. Under relaxed ANSI/ISO mode, the compiler accepts language extensions that could potentially conflict with ANSI/ISO C/C++. Under strict ANSI mode, these language extensions are suppressed so that the compiler will accept all strictly conforming programs.

                                <p>If you want to link object files created with the TI CodeGen tools with object files generated by other compiler tool chains, the ARM standard specifies that you should define the _AEABI_PORTABILITY_LEVEL preprocessor symbol as follows before #including any standard header files, such as &lt;stdlib.h&gt;.</p>
                                <code>#define _AEABI_PORTABILITY_LEVEL 1</code>
                                <p>This definition enables full portability. Defining the symbol to 0 specifies that the "C standard" portability level will be used.</p>

                                    <p> Under relaxed ANSI/ISO mode (the default), the compiler accepts language extensions that could potentially conflict with a strictly conforming ANSI/ISO C/C++ program. Under strict ANSI mode, these language extensions are suppressed so that the compiler will accept all strictly conforming programs.</p>
                                    <p>Use the --strict_ansi option when you know your program is a conforming program and it will not compile in relaxed mode. In this mode, language extensions that conflict with ANSI/ISO C/C++ are disabled and the compiler will emit error messages where the standard requires it to do so. Violations that are considered discretionary by the standard may be emitted as warnings instead.</p>

To get the compiler to accept this code, use strict ANSI mode. The compiler will suppress the interrupt keyword language exception, and interrupt may then be used as an identifier in the code.</p>

                                <p> The GNU compiler collection (GCC) defines a number of language features not found in the ANSI/ISO C and C++ standards. The definition and examples of these extensions (for GCC version 4.7) can be found at the GNU web site, <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.2/gcc/C-Extensions.html#C-Extensions" target="_blank">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.7.2/gcc/C-Extensions.html#C-Extensions</a>. Most of these extensions are also available for C++ source code. </p>
                                <p>The compiler also supports the following Clang macro extensions, which are described in the <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/LanguageExtensions.html" target="_blank">Clang 6 Documentation</a>:</p>

                                <p>In addition, the compiler supports many of the features described in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/compilers/arm-compiler-5/docs/101028/latest/1-preface" target="_blank">ARM C Language Extensions (ACLE) specification</a>. These features are applicable for the Cortex-M and Cortex-R processor variants. ACLE support affects the pre-defined macros (<span class="crossreference"><a href="using-the-c-c-compiler.html#t365166-1">Table 2-30</a></span>), function attributes (<span class="crossreference"><a href="#SPRU1878303">Section 5.16.2</a></span>), and intrinsics (<span class="crossreference"><a href="#SPNU1517034">Section 5.13</a></span>) you may use in C/C++ code. These features are implemented in order to support the development of source code that can be compiled using ACLE-compliant compilers from multiple vendors for a variety of ARM processors.</p>

                                    <p>For example, this function declaration uses the <b>alias</b> attribute to make "my_alias" a function alias for the "myFunc" function:</p>
                                    <code>void my_alias() __attribute__((alias("myFunc")));</code>
                                    <p>The <b>format</b> attribute is applied to the declarations of printf, fprintf, sprintf, snprintf, vprintf, vfprintf, vsprintf, vsnprintf, scanf, fscanf, vfscanf, vscanf, vsscanf, and sscanf in stdio.h. Thus when GCC extensions are enabled, the data arguments of these functions are type checked against the format specifiers in the format string argument and warnings are issued when there is a mismatch. These warnings can be suppressed in the usual ways if they are not desired. </p>
                                    <p>See <span class="crossreference"><a href="#STDZ0556804">Section 5.10.15</a></span> for more about using the <b>interrupt</b> function attribute.</p>
                                    <p>The <b>malloc</b> attribute is applied to the declarations of malloc, calloc, realloc and memalign in stdlib.h. </p>
                                    <p>The <b>ramfunc</b> attribute specifies that a function will be placed in and executed from RAM. The ramfunc attribute allows the compiler to optimize functions for RAM execution, as well as to automatically copy functions to RAM on flash-based devices. For example:</p>
                                    <code>__attribute__((ramfunc))
void f(void) {
 ... 
}
</code>
                                    <p>The --ramfunc=on option specifies that all functions compiled with this option are placed in and executed from RAM, even if this function attribute is not used.</p>
                                    <p>Newer TI linker command files support the ramfunc attribute automatically by placing functions with this attribute in the .TI.ramfunc section. If you have a linker command file that does not include a section specification for the .TI.ramfunc section, you can modify the linker command file to place this section in RAM. See the <a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Placing_functions_in_RAM" target="_blank">Placing functions in RAM</a> wiki page for more about the ramfunc attribute and option. See the <i><span>ARM </span> Assembly Language Tools User's Guide</i> for details on section placement.</p>
                                    <p>The <b>target</b> attribute causes the function to be compiled in either ARM (32-bit) or Thumb (16-bit) mode. The target attribute has the same effect as using the CODE_STATE pragma. The following examples use the target attribute.</p>
                                    <code>__attribute__((target("arm"))) void foo(int arg1, int arg2)
__attribute__((target("thumb"))) void foo(int arg1, int arg2)
</code>
                                    <p>Note that the "pcs" attribute described in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/compilers/arm-compiler-5/docs/101028/latest/1-preface" target="_blank">ACLE specification</a> is not supported.</p>

                                    <p> The following variable attributes are supported: aligned, deprecated, mode, <span>noinit, persistent, </span>section, transparent_union, unused, <span>used, and weak</span>. </p>
                                    <p>The <b>used</b> attribute is defined in GCC 4.2 (see <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.2.4/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html#Variable-Attributes" target="_blank">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.2.4/gcc/Variable-Attributes.html#Variable-Attributes</a>).</p>
                                    <p>In addition, the <b>packed</b> attribute may be applied to individual fields within a struct or union. The packed attribute is supported on all ARM targets. See the description of the --unaligned_access option for more information on how the compiler accesses unaligned data.</p>

                                        <span class="section-label">5.16.4 </span>Type Attributes</h4>
                                    <p>The following type attributes are supported: aligned, deprecated, <span>packed, </span>transparent_union, <span>and unused</span>.</p>
                                    <p>The <b>packed</b> attribute is supported for struct and union types. It is supported on all ARM targets if the --relaxed_ansi option is used. See the description of the --unaligned_access option for more information on how the compiler accesses unaligned data.</p>
                                    <p>Members of a packed structure are stored as closely to each other as possible, omitting additional bytes of padding usually added to preserve word-alignment. For example, assuming a word-size of 4 bytes ordinarily has 3 bytes of padding between members c1 and i, and another 3 bytes of trailing padding after member c2, leading to a total size of 12 bytes:</p>
                                    <code>    struct unpacked_struct { char c1; int i; char c2;}; </code>
                                    <p> However, the members of a packed struct are byte-aligned. Thus the following does not have any bytes of padding between or after members and totals 6 bytes:</p>
                                    <code>   struct __attribute__((__packed__)) packed_struct { char c1; int i; char c2; };</code>
                                    <p>Subsequently, packed structures in an array are packed together without trailing padding between array elements.</p>
                                    <p>Bit fields of a packed structure are bit-aligned. The byte alignment of adjacent struct members that are not bit fields does not change. However, there are no bits of padding between adjacent bit fields. </p>
                                    <p>The <b>packed</b> attribute can only be applied to the original definition of a structure or union type. It cannot be applied with a typedef to a non-packed structure that has already been defined, nor can it be applied to the declaration of a struct or union object. Therefore, any given structure or union type can only be packed or non-packed, and all objects of that type will inherit its packed or non-packed attribute.</p>
                                    <p>The packed attribute is not applied recursively to structure types that are contained within a packed structure. Thus, in the following example the member s retains the same internal layout as in the first example above. There is no padding between c and s, so s falls on an unaligned boundary: </p>
                                    <code>   struct __attribute__((__packed__)) outer_packed_struct { char c; struct unpacked_struct s; };</code>
                                    <p>It is illegal to implicitly or explicitly cast the address of a packed struct member as a pointer to any non-packed type except an unsigned char. In the following example, p1, p2, and the call to foo are all illegal. </p>
                                    <code>   void foo(int *param);
 struct packed_struct ps;

 int *p1 = &amp;ps.i;
 int *p2 = (int *)&amp;ps.i;
 foo(&amp;ps.i);</code>
                                    <p>However, it is legal to explicitly cast the address of a packed struct member as a pointer to an unsigned char:</p>
                                    <code>   unsigned char *pc = (unsigned char *)&amp;ps.i;
</code>
                                    <p>The TI compiler also supports an <b>unpacked</b> attribute for an enumeration type to allow you to indicate that the representation is to be an integer type that is no smaller than int; in other words, it is not <i>packed</i>. </p>

                                <p>Due to the variety of host systems supported by the C/C++ compiler and the limitations of some of these systems, the compiler may not be able to successfully compile source files that are excessively large or complex. In general, exceeding such a system limit prevents continued compilation, so the compiler aborts immediately after printing the error message. Simplify the program to avoid exceeding a system limit.</p>
                                <p>Some systems do not allow filenames longer than 500 characters. Make sure your filenames are shorter than 500.</p>
                                <p>The compiler has no arbitrary limits but is limited by the amount of memory available on the host system. On smaller host systems such as PCs, the optimizer may run out of memory. If this occurs, the optimizer terminates and the shell continues compiling the file with the code generator. This results in a file compiled with no optimization. The optimizer compiles one function at a time, so the most likely cause of this is a large or extremely complex function in your source module. To correct the problem, your options are:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li value="1">Don't optimize the module in question.</li>
