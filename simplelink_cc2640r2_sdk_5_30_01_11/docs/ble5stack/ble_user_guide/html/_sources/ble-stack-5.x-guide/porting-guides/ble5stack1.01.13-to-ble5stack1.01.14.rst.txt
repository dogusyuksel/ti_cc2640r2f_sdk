BLE5-Stack 1.01.13 (SDK 5.10) to BLE5-Stack 1.01.14 (SDK 5.30)
==============================================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE5-Stack 1.01.13
to a BLE5-Stack 1.01.14 project.

For this migration guide, simple\_peripheral from BLE5-Stack 1.01.13 will be
ported over to BLE5-Stack 1.01.14. Because the directory structure is nearly
identical between the two releases, the recommended approach is to start with a
BLE5-Stack 1.01.14 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE5-Stack 1.01.14 example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality.

   For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_

   In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
   BLE5-Stack 1.01.14 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE5-Stack 1.01.13 into the
   BLE5-Stack 1.01.14 example project.

   In this example, the following files from BLE5-Stack 1.01.13 were moved into
   simple\_peripheral BLE5-Stack 1.01.14 example:

   - ``simple_peripheral.c``
   - ``simple_peripheral.h``

#. Modify ``main.c`` in the BLE5-Stack 1.01.14 example if additional tasks were
   added in the BLE5-Stack 1.01.13 project.

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are
   supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the TI-RTOS
   examples included with |SDK|.

   For additional information on how BLE5-Stack 1.01.14 uses TI-RTOS see

   For any utilized TI Drivers, review `TI-RTOS Kernel (SYS/BIOS) User's Guide
