BLE-Stack 3.03.07 (SDK 4.40) to BLE-Stack 3.03.08 (SDK 5.10)
============================================================

This section will describe a way to migrate a project from BLE-Stack 3.03.07 to
a BLE-Stack 3.03.08.

There are little or no changes in the examples, but the method provided below 
is a general safe approach to adopt.

For this migration guide, simple_peripheral from BLE-Stack 3.03.07 will be
ported over to BLE-Stack 3.03.08. Because the directory structure is
identical between the two releases, the recommended approach is to start with
a BLE-Stack 3.03.08 project that contains the same base functionality as the
porting target project and merge in any custom functionality.

#. Choose a BLE-Stack 3.03.08 example project that contains your target
   project's base functionality.

   For reference, see available sample projects that start with simple\_.

   In this example, we're going to use simple\_peripheral as the starting
   BLE-Stack 3.03.07 sample project.

#. Transfer all modified application files from BLE-Stack 3.03.07 into the
   BLE-Stack 3.03.08 example project.

   In this example, the following files from BLE-Stack 3.03.07 were moved into
   simple\_peripheral BLE-Stack 3.03.08 example:

    - ``simple_peripheral.c``
    - ``simple_peripheral.h``

#. If necessary, update the project to use the newer TI-RTOS drivers that are
   supplied with the |SDK|.

#. Refer to the Core SDK release notes for additional information and the TI-RTOS
   examples included with |SDK|.

   For additional information on how BLE-Stack 3.03.07 uses TI-RTOS see

   For any utilized TI Drivers, review `TI-RTOS Kernel (SYS/BIOS) User's Guide 
   <..\/..\/..\/..\/tirtos\/sysbios\/docs\/Bios_User_Guide.pdf>`_ and 
   `TI Drivers API Reference <..\/..\/..\/..\/tidrivers\/tidriversAPIs.html>`_.
